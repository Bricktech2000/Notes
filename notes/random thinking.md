# Random Thinking

## feces smell bad

the probable reason for the bad smell of feces is to prevent us from eating them

## everything is a subscription

every (physical) purchase is a subscription, or recurring payment. as every physical object has a finite lifetime, its price can be thought of as the length of the subscription to said object. a smart phone that lasts **`3`** years and costs **`2000 \$`** has a subscription of **`2000 \$ -- 3"y"`**, which is **`56 \$ -- "mo"`**

## different view on smart phones

smart phones can be thought of as a set of input-output devices joined together by a general-purpose processing unit. apps simply use the general-purpose processing unit to join the right input and output devices together, creating unique functionality.

- the camera app uses the phone camera and the screen as input and uses the phone storage and the screen as output
- the music app uses the phone storage and the screen as input and uses the phone speaker and the screen as output

## fidelity programs

fidelity programs are a way to lock clients into an ecosystem. this fact is sometimes made explicit (as does Desjardins) but sometimes made implicit (as does Apple)

## time = money

[[time]] is [[money]]. the equation that links the two concepts together are one's salary. when working, one's time is sold for the amount of money they earn.

videos agreeing with this opinion: <https://youtu.be/oh3sAxd9-jw?t=242>, <https://youtu.be/Q8vYmIvIr4o?t=231>, <https://youtu.be/J5SXT9r2214?t=289>

## units in programming

having units in [[programming language]]s would solve a lot of issues, such as:

- forgetting to multiply by `dt` in a [[video game]] engine
- sending [[time]] to a `sleep` function in milliseconds as opposed to seconds

## we are a tiny subset of everything

humans are a minuscule slice of everything. we look for life that have **evolved using water** and that are **roughly our size**. we try to split materials into [[atom]]s into elementary particles and assume that **there is a lower limit to how our world can be divided**. we assume that the universe must be the **interaction of "simple" rules**. we try to communicate with other life forms that are **roughly our level of intelligence**

all the items in bold are a minuscule subset of what is possible. as an example, solar systems are relatively simple when viewed abstractly and gravity is a simple force that pulls spheres together. well, what if the elementary particles we keep looking for are in reality equivalent to planets? maybe they hide huge complexity, but seem simple when looked at as spheres affected by gravity. as another example, it would be almost impossible to teach the rules of the game of life to chimpanzees. explaining those rules to humans would take a few minutes. this is a case of [[empathy by inversion]]. thinking about it, the intelligence of humans and of chimpanzees are actually identical when viewed in the context of all possible intelligence levels. if we find that difference significant, then intelligence levels higher than ours go so high that it is impossible for us to even attempt to understand them.

all of that to say that there might very well be no point in looking for answers at all
