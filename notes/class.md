# Class

_the blueprint of an [[object]]_

an [[object]] has a state, whereas a [[class]] does not

### definitions

> **definition**: two [[class]]es are said to be _coupled_ if the implementation of one of them depends on the implementation of the other. this is to be avoided

## Java Classes

see [[java]]

### contains

see [[object]]

- properties
- methods
- nested [[class]]es

which can all either be:

- static or not (belong to the [[class]] or to an instance or [[object]])
- public, (no value, package), protected or private
- final or not

> **note**: the order in which [[class]] properties and methods are defined in [[java]] is irrelevant

### definitions

> **definition**: a _final variable_ can only be initialized once
