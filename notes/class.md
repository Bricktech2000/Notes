# Class

_the blueprint of an [[object]]_

> **definition**: two [[class]]es are said to be _coupled_ if the implementation of one of them depends on the implementation of the other. this is to be avoided

> **property**: an [[object]] has a state whereas a [[class]] does not (duplicate)

## Java Classes

see [[java]]

> **property**: in a [[java]] [[class]], a _final variable_ can only be initialized once

> **property**: in a [[java]] [[class]], the order in which properties and methods are defined is irrelevant
