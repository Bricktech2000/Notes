# Discounted Cash Flow

**see** [[economics]], [[math notation]]

loosely speaking, a [[discounted cash flow]] analysis seeks to estimate the value of an asset based on the **present value of its future cash flows**

**definition**

**`"DCF" = $ t. F[G-D]t {@@ .. 0} = F -- /D-G\`** --- me, where

- **`F`** is the current _free cash flow_
- **`G`** is the _growth rate_ of the cash flow
- **`D`** is the _discount rate_ of the cash flow
- **`"DCF"`** is the _discounted cash flow_

> **example**
>
> `AAPL` has been growing at around **`1 25-100`** year over year for the last few years --- <https://youtu.be/Shuu4f_5YMY?t=298>. to be on the safe side, let's estimate a future growth rate of **`G = 1 10-100`**. money in the future isn't worth as much as money in the present, so we need to discount the future cash flows by some rate **`D`**. `SPX` averages around **`1 10-100`** --- <https://youtu.be/Shuu4f_5YMY?t=469>. let's be conservative and use **`D = 1 20-100`**. in 2016, `AAPL` had a free cash flow of **`53[10]9"USD"`** --- <https://youtu.be/Shuu4f_5YMY?t=242>. let's use **`F = 53[10]9"USD"`** as the current cash flow
>
> we then get **`"DCF" = 609[10]9"USD"`**. adding the **`67[10]9"USD"`** of high-[[liquidity]] assets `AAPL` owned in 2016 --- <https://youtu.be/Shuu4f_5YMY?t=572>, we get an estimated intrinsic value of **`676[10]9"USD"`**
