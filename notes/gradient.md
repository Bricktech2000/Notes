# Gradient

_returns a [[vector in rn]] representing the direction of steepest ascent of a [[function]] at a given point_

**see** [[calculus]], [[derivative#partial derivative]]s

**notation** _in [[conventional math notation]]_ the [[gradient]] of $f$ is denoted $\nabla f(\dots)$

**definition** let $f$ be a [[function]] differentiable at $p \equiv (x \cdots)$. then, the [[gradient]] of $f$ at $p$ is defined to be $\delta\ f\ p - \delta p$
