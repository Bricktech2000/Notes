**see** [[nonverbal#connotation]]

> **examples**
>
> - "I don't have time" &mdash; _I don't deem this important enough to make [[time]] for_. everyone has **`24 "h"`** to work with every day. if something were **actually** important to you, you would make [[time]] for it &mdash; <https://youtu.be/suG-oqsdcGo?t=0> and <https://youtu.be/6o2tm00Ar8A?t=724>
> - "I can't afford it" &mdash; _I'm indifferent to being powerless when it comes to my [[wealth]]_. you don't have the [[money]] to afford it **yet**. how can you get to the point where you do have the [[money]] to afford it? &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=362>
> - "that won't work" &mdash; _I don't know how to make it work_. you don't have the [[knowledge]] to make it work **yet**. and that doesn't mean other people don't have that [[knowledge]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=12795>

> **example** the word _can't_ is very dangerous. it represents the belief that there exists some mystical external force preventing you from doing something. however, more often than not, reflecting on what that external force actually is will reveal that you can still be in control of the situation

[[verbal#connotation]] can also be used [[intention]]ally to convey information implicitly

> **examples**
>
> - _we **expect** to achieve sales of [...]_ &bull; _we **hope** to achieve sales of [...]_. the former has a [[verbal#connotation]] of confidence whereas the latter does not
> - _thank you for this **opportunity**, and **have** a great night_ &bull; _thank you for **listening**, I **hope** you enjoyed_. the latter has a [[verbal#connotation]] implying people stayed and listened out of politeness whereas the former does not &mdash; <https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY>
> - _they **will** get it touch soon_ &bull; _they **should** get it touch soon_. the latter has a [[verbal#connotation]] of uncertainty whereas the latter does not &mdash; Hack the Hill#sponsorship
> - _**when** we come to paint these windows, we will [...]_ &bull; _**if** we come to paint these windows, we will [...]_. the former has a [[verbal#connotation]] which assumes the sale whereas the latter does not &mdash; _Student Works Operations Manual_ (2023) p. 33

> **example** protagonists of the debate over abortion call themselves _pro-life_ and _pro-choice_. this is not a coincidence &mdash; who would want to be _anti-life_ or _anti-choice_? &mdash; _Petit cours d'autod√©fense intellectuelle_ p. 25

_euphemisms_ are a type of [[verbal#connotation]]; they are words or phrases that conceal an unpleasant or offensive truth
