# Verbal

**aka** _verbal communication_

**see** [[nonverbal]]

## Connotation

_an association that any given word or phrase carries_

**see** [[nonverbal#connotation]]

> **note** this interpretation of _connotation_ was made up by me

> **examples**
>
> - "I don't have time" &mdash; _I don't deem this important enough to make [[time]] for_. everyone has **`24 "h"`** to work with every day. if something were **actually** important to you, you would make [[time]] for it &mdash; <https://youtu.be/suG-oqsdcGo?t=0> and <https://youtu.be/6o2tm00Ar8A?t=724>
> - "I can't afford it" &mdash; _I'm indifferent to being powerless when it comes to my [[wealth]]_. you don't have the [[money]] to afford it **yet**. how can you get to the point where you do have the [[money]] to afford it? &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=362>
> - "that won't work" &mdash; _I don't know how to make it work_. you don't have the [[knowledge]] to make it work **yet**. and that doesn't mean other people don't have that [[knowledge]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=12795>

> **example** the word _can't_ is very dangerous. it represents the belief that there exists some mystical external force preventing you from doing something. however, more often than not, reflecting on what that external force actually is will reveal that you can still be in control of the situation

[[verbal#connotation]] can also be used [[intention]]ally to convey information implicitly

> **examples**
>
> - > we **expect** to achieve sales of [...]
>
>   > we **hope** to achieve sales of [...]
>
>   the former has a [[verbal#connotation]] of confidence whereas the latter does not
>
> - > thank you for this **opportunity**, and **have** a great night
>
>   > thank you for **listening**, I **hope** you enjoyed
>
>   the latter has a [[verbal#connotation]] implying people stayed and listened out of politeness whereas the former does not &mdash; <https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY>
>
> - > they **will** get it touch soon
>
>   > they **should** get it touch soon
>
>   the latter has a [[verbal#connotation]] of uncertainty whereas the latter does not &mdash; Hack the Hill #sponsorship
>
> - > **when** we come to paint these windows, we will [...]
>
>   > **if** we come to paint these windows, we will [...]
>
>   the former has a [[verbal#connotation]] indicating the sale is already done whereas the latter does not &mdash; Student Works Operations Manual, 2023, p. 33
