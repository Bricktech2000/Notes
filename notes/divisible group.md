**definition** a [[divisible group]] is a finite or infinite [[set]] of elements equipped with a closed associative commutative binary operation that can be applied a [[rational]] number of times &mdash; Wikipedia and me

**definition** an [[abelian group]] **`G`** is a _divisible group_ if and only if **`G y /\ [y]n = g > NN n > G g`**, or, equivalently, if and only if **`[G]n = G`**
