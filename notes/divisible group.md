**definition** a _divisible group_ is an [[abelian group]] whose [[abelian group#operation]] can be applied a [[rational]] number of times

**definition** a [[divisible group]] is a [[set]] of elements equipped with a closed associative commutative binary operation that can be applied a [[rational]] number of times --- Wikipedia and me

**definition** an [[abelian group]] $G$ is a _divisible group_ if and only if $\forall n \in \mathbb N, g \in G.\ \exists y \in G.\ y^n = g$, or, equivalently, if and only if $\forall n \in \mathbb N.\ G^n = G$

> **note** not sure why [[divisible group]]s are defined to be abelian
