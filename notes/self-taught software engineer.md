- use curriculum from coding bootcamps to build own curriculum

[[self-taught software engineer]]s need a great portfolio as they do not have a degree to back their skills up

- [x] have a good readme for projects
- [ ] make projects interactive
- [x] write good project commit messages

## getting a fist job

- practice for interviews as they can be "brutal"
- also apply to jobs that "require" a Bachelor's degree. this is where a great portfolio is so important
- keep in mind that this is a **first job**; it doesn't have to be perfect
- networking can be more effective than applying to jobs on job boards
  - reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn
  - attend tech events, conferences, hackathons, meetups, etc.
  - attend career fairs

_the hardest part about this whole journey is getting that first job---but once you get that first job, recruiters are gonna be messaging you almost everyday_

coding interviews are about more than just programming --- <https://youtu.be/0Z9RW_hhUT4>
