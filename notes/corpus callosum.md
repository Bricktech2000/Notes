# Corpus Callosum

_the largest white matter tract in the brain_

the [[corpus callosum]] is a C-shaped structure of [[white matter]] and [[nerve]] pathways that connects the two [[cerebral cortex]] hemispheres to provide a route of direct communication

_agenesis of corpus callosum_ is a rare disorder present at birth that is characterized by the partial or complete absence of the [[corpus callosum]]. the [[corpus callosum]] can also be severed to treat severe epilepsy and seizures. both of these conditions can lead to interesting side effects
