# Intellectual Giftedness

**aka** _high intellectual potential_

**see** [[intellectual disability]]

&mdash; La Douance

defining [[intellectual giftedness]] as a level of [[intelligence]] more than two [[standard deviation]]s above the [[mean]] is simplistic and misleading. [[iq]] tests only measure a subset of an individual's [[intelligence]], and their results are highly dependent on external factors affecting [[focus]] such as [[anxiety]] and stress, quality of [[sleep]], daily [[cognitive load]], and so on

biological characteristics are a necessary condition for [[intellectual giftedness]], but in no way a sufficient one. the development of a [[high intellectual potential]] is highly dependent on it being nurtured and supported by the environment in which the individual grows up, and on a fair amount of [[luck]]

giftedness is dynamic; it can manifest at certain times, in certain ways, with certain people, and in certain environments, but not at others. consequently, a gifted individual is best identified by their "gifted behaviors". gifted behaviors are visible manifestations of a [high potential] combined with a high level of [[creativity]] and a high level of [[motivation]]

## #todo

[[creativity]]

[[high intellectual potential]], [high potential], [giftedness]

#think _douance_ seems to be synonymous with _giftedness_ and not _intellectual giftedness_

#think [[high intellectual potential]] seems to be a subset of _high potential_
