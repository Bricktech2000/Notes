# Intellectual Giftedness

**see** [[intellectual disability]]

defining [[intellectual giftedness]] as having an [[iq]] more than two [[standard deviation]]s above the [[mean]] is simplistic and misleading. [[iq]] tests only measure a subset of an individual's [[intelligence]], and their results are highly dependent on external factors affecting [[focus]] such as [[anxiety]] and stress, quality of [[sleep]], daily [[cognitive load]], and so on

biological characteristics are a necessary condition for [[intellectual giftedness]], but in no way are they a sufficient one. the development of a _high intellectual potential_ is highly dependent on it being nurtured and supported by the environment and on a fair amount of [[luck]]

giftedness is dynamic; it can manifest at certain times, in certain ways, with certain people, and in certain environments, but not others. consequently, a gifted individual is best identified by their "gifted behaviors". gifted behaviors are visible manifestations of a _high potential_ combined with a high level of creativity and a high level of [[motivation]]

_intellectual giftedness_ is a subset of _giftedness_ focused on intellectual abilities. _high potential_ is to _giftedness_ what _high intellectual potential_ is to _intellectual giftedness_

giftedness, ADHD and ASDs have similar diagnostic criteria and classic signs; they are differentiated by what lies beneath: &mdash; <https://youtu.be/jOdQ4g1gjJU>
