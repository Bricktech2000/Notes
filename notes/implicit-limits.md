# Implicit Limits

see [[math-notation]]

Would there be any disadvantage to having every mathematical expression be implicitly evaluated using [[limit]]s?

Is there any situation in which an undefined value would be required?

This would allow for any algebraic manipulation on expressions without having to worry about restrictions.

## Update

the following video breaks the principle stated above.

$\lim_{x \to 0} (x - x)$

$(\lim_{x \to 0} x) - x$
