# Public Speaking

## structure

be very explicit about the structure of a talk.

_here's what I'll talk about and here is what you'll learn by listening. let's start with [...]. now, [...]. alright so that's all for [...]. let's now discuss [...]_

[[verbal]] punctuation can be used to convey structure. it also [[nonverbal]]ly tells people who fogged out it's a good time to join back in

explicitly link [[concept]]s and ideas together instead of listing them

> **examples**
>
> - start with an empowerment promise. explain why people are listening to you
> - when using slides, mention the title [[verbal]]ly instead of cluttering the slides with it
> - use linking words when jumping from one idea to the next
> - introduce and wrap up each point with an introduction and a conclusion

## nonverbals

**see** [[nonverbal]]

keep visual contact with the audience

### speaker confidence

look like someone confident and comfortable

> **examples**
>
> - study the room beforehand to be comfortable with it
> - walk around and look around to show confidence
> - show your hands and use them to demonstrate concepts
> - look passionate towards the subject you are talking about (duplicate)

### artificial interest

trick people into being interested through [[nonverbal]]s

> **examples**
>
> - talk in a well-lit room to keep people fully awake and connected
> - make sure the room is populated to make the talk seem desirable
> - ask questions and [[rhetorical question]]s to get people to engage

### empathetic mirroring

make people feel what you are feeling by exploiting empathetic mirroring

> **examples**
>
> - write on a chalk board manually to make people understand the importance of a concept
> - use real-life examples and anecdotes allow people to connect
> - use props and strong visuals to enhance the empathetic effects
> - look passionate towards the subject you are talking about (duplicate)

## other

### facts

a joke is not a great way to start a talk as most people are still settling in and getting used to your way of speaking. they likely won't laugh at it

after asking a question, wait around 7 seconds for an answer from the audience

flipping through slides can be too quick for people. the speed at which one writes on a chalkboard is approximately the speed at which people absorb information

see [[verbal#connotation]]s

### other tools

use repetition and examples to convey the importance of some information

build a fence around your ideas to distinguish them from somebody else's ideas

use slides as a visual complement to your ideas
