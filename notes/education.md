## Mass Education

_free, public schooling for wide segments of a nation's population_

today, schools attempt to meet the needs of industrial and post-industrial society by teaching a **wide diversity of students** a **myriad of topics**

living in residences is encouraged for first-year students to **help them build their network**, to form connections that will last the rest of our lives

### pros & cons

see [[thinking]]

mass [[education]] often results in students learning bad habits. examples include:

- to perform a calculation, reaching for a physical calculator instead of using their phone or performing it mentally because school imposes physical calculators in exams
- writing in a [[vague-ambiguous-generic]] manner suffering from [[wordiness]] because school imposes word count minimums but never maximums
