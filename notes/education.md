# Education

**definition** _education_ is the social institution responsible for the systematic transmission of [[knowledge]], skills and cultural values within a formally organized structure

## mass education

**see** [[math notation]]

_free, public schooling for wide segments of a nation's population_

today, schools attempt to meet the needs of industrial and post-industrial society by teaching a **wide diversity of students** a **myriad of topics**

**cons**

mass [[education]] often results in students learning bad habits. examples include:

- to perform a calculation, reaching for a physical calculator instead of using their phone or performing it mentally because school imposes physical calculators in exams
- writing in a [[vague ambiguous generic]] manner suffering from [[wordiness]] because school imposes word count minimums but never maximums

a lot of degrees nowadays don't seem like they're worth the [[time]] and [[money]] [[invest]]ed in them. both adults in this video <https://youtu.be/crj3IOuSrdY> had to pay back student debt from colledge, but have had to work at positions such as a waitress in a restaurant and in a bar, a highschool math teacher, a tutor, a pizza deliverer, and a "fraud investigator" &mdash; all of which had a salary in the range of **`20 000 \$ -- "y" ... 35 000 \$ -- "y"`**

[[education]]al institutions evolve at a very slow rate. it has happened in the past that students pursuing a PhD (in machine learning in this case) realized partway through their degree that all the research they had done was obsolete. this is an extreme example, but it shows that [[education]]al institutions are not always up to date with the latest developments in rapidly evolving fields

[[education]]al institutions focus on the average student, and not on the top students, see [[intelligence]]. this is a problem because top students are likely the ones who will make the largest contributions to society

both [[education]]al institutions and their students focus on grades, and not necessarily on learning. this is a problem because of [[goodhart's law]]

[[finance]]ial skills are not taught in schools. even smart doctors and lawyers can be [[finance]]ially illiterate, regardless of how much [[money]] they make or of what grades they received &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=258>

[[nonverbal]] communication is not taught in schools, despite its importance &mdash; <https://youtu.be/f9SA25OukyM?t=1009>
