# Education

see [[math-notation]]

> the social institution responsible for the systematic transmission of knowledge, skills and cultural values within a formally organized structure

> **definition**: _cultural transmission_ is the process by which children and recent immigrants become acquainted with the dominant cultural beliefs, values, norms and accumulated knowledge of a society, through _informal_ and _formal_ education.

## Mass Education

_free, public schooling for wide segments of a nation's population_

today, schools attempt to meet the needs of industrial and post-industrial society by teaching a **wide diversity of students** a **myriad of topics**

living in residences is encouraged for first-year students to **help them build their network**, to form connections that will last the rest of our lives

**cons**

mass [[education]] often results in students learning bad habits, see [[thinking]]. examples include:

- to perform a calculation, reaching for a physical calculator instead of using their phone or performing it mentally because school imposes physical calculators in exams
- writing in a [[vague-ambiguous-generic]] manner suffering from [[wordiness]] because school imposes word count minimums but never maximums

a lot of degrees nowadays don't seem like they're worth the [[time]] and [[money]] invested in them, see [[thinking]]. both adults in this video <https://youtu.be/crj3IOuSrdY> had to pay back student debt from colledge, but have had to work at positions such as a waitress in a restaurant and in a bar, a highschool math teacher, a tutor, a pizza deliverer, and a "fraud investigator" &mdash; all of which had a salary in the range of $20\ 000\text{\$-y}\ \dots\ 35\ 000\text{\$-y}$
