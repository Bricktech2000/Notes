# Resonance Structure

see [[bond]], [[lewis-structure]]

> **definition**: Equivalent Lewis dot structures, such as those of ozone, are called _resonance structures_. The [[position]] of the atoms is the same in the various [[resonance-structure]]s of a compound, but the [[position]] of the [[electron]]s is different. Double-headed arrows link the different [[resonance-structure]]s of a compound. The double-headed arrow indicates that the actual electronic structure is an average of those shown, not that the molecule oscillates between the two structures. &mdash; Chemistry LibreTexts
