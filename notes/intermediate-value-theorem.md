# Intermediate Value Theorem

see [[math-notation]]

> **theorem**: let $f\ x$ be a continuous [[function]] on the interval $x \rightarrow (a \le x \le b)$ and $u$ such that $f\ a \le u \le f\ b \lor f\ b \le u \le f\ a$ ($u$ is between $f\ a$ and $f\ b$). then, there is a $c$ in $c \rightarrow (a < c < b)$ such that $f\ c = u$ &mdash; Wikipedia
