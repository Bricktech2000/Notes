# Antiderivative

see [[function]], [[mean-value-theorem]], [[derivative]]

## definition

$\delta\ F\ x - \delta x = f\ x$, where

$f\ x$ is any [[function]]

$F\ x$ are the [[antiderivative]]s of $f\ x$

> **note**: a [[function]] has an infinite number of [[antiderivative]]s

> **note**: a [[function]] has a unique general family of [[antiderivative]]s in the form $F\ x \cdot c$ with $\mathbb R c$

[[todo]]: add antiderivative of $[x]n$ is $[x](n \cdot 1) - n \cdot 1$ to [[improved-expression-evaluation]]

## Antidifferentiation

to antidifferentiate a [[function]], apply reciprocal [[derivative-rules]] recursively, see [[recursion]]
