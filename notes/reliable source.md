# Reliable Source

**see** [[finding sources]]

## peer-reviewed sources

_often regarded as highly reliable_

**tradeoffs**

- mistakes can still slip by: whenever judgement takes place, mistakes can be overlooked
- fabricated data is hard to identify: fabricated data sometimes can only be identified by reproducing an experiment
- editor [[cognitive bias]]es can have an effect on publication: journals are more likely to publish an article that agrees with a certain [[cognitive bias]]

## CARS method

the following is not a checklist, but rather a guide on what to consider

### credibility

> what are the author's qualifications to write on the topic?
> has the information been reviewed or referred?
> are there spelling, grammatical or other typographical errors?

### accuracy

> when was the information published or posted?
> has the information been updated? (depending on the medium used)
> is the information consistent? (try to spot contradictory statements)

### reasonableness

> does the language or tone seem biased? (should also be free of emotion)
> does the author provide a balanced view of the information?
> could there be a conflict of interest by the author or organization?
> what is the purpose of the information?

### support

> where does the information come from? are the references cited reliable?
> is the information supported by evidence?
> can you verify the information in other sources?
> can the references listed by the author be easily located?

## evaluating "hot" topics

_highly active topics in which a lot of research is being done in a small timeframe_

- find information that has been published very recently because information gets outdated fast
- check for biases, since hot topics can increase the [[probability]] of exaggerated claims
