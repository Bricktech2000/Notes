the [[xy problem]] is a communication problem characterized by a party asking about an **attempted solution** rather than about the **original problem**

asking a technical question is a balancing act. the [[xy problem]] occurs when a question's scope is overly narrowed; however, it is worth realizing that asking too broad of a question is just as problematic. often, there is no "original" problem. every decision sits on top of a [[tree]] of other decisions, and figuring out how much to unwind before asking a question is non-trivial

> the question _how do I extract the last three characters of a string_ suffers from the [[xy problem]]; however, the questions _how do I tally up file types in a directory and sort them_ and _how do I find out what types of files are on my hard drive_ are vague and hard to refine and come off as lazy
