**definition** an _abelian group_ is a [[group]] whose [[group#operation]] is commutative

**definition** an [[abelian group]] is a [[set]] of invertible elements equipped with a closed associative commutative binary operation and an identity element --- Wikipedia and me

**definition** a [[group]] $G$ is an _abelian group_ if and only if $\forall a, b \in G.\ a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
