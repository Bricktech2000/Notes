# Incorrect Measurement Scale Use

_using the incorrect scale for a measurement_

see [[math notation]]

this seems to be a common problem among the general public, and frustrates me very much

> **examples** _scale examples &mdash; with correct use, and example use_
>
> - bell curve &mdash; for quantities with a normal distribution, $\cdot 2 \sigma$
> - pie chart &mdash; for quantities that add up to a whole, $0.2 : 0.3 : 0.5 = 0$
> - [[logarithm]]ic scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a base
> - fractional scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a whole, $20 \%$, $2 - 10$

> **examples** _incorrect scale uses &mdash; with correct use_
>
> - rating someone's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 10 &mdash; should use a bell curve instead
> - comparing populations using a linear scale &mdash; should use a logarithmic scale instead
> - representing budget distribution with a fractional scale &mdash; should use a pie chart instead
> - comparing prices with dollar amounts &mdash; should use a fractional scale instead
> - representing probabilities of precipitation with a percentage &mdash; should use a probability distribution instead
