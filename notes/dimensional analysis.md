# Dimensional Analysis

**definition** [...] _dimensional analysis_ is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]]) and units of measurement (such as meters and grams) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis>

_dimensional homogeneity_ states that **`E = F < "dim" E = "dim" F`** for any equality or inequality

**applications**

[[dimensional analysis]] can be used as a [[trick]] to avoid memorizing formulas
