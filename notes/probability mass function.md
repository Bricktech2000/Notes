**see** [[math notation]], [[probability distribution]]

**definition** a _probability mass function_ is a [[function]] **`f`** that [[map]]s an event to its [[probability]] of occurrence such that **`:f = 1`**

> **example** the probability mass function of a fair dice roll is **`x -> --6`**

**applications**

probability mass functions are used to describe discrete random variables
