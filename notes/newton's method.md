# Newton's Method

**see** [[derivative]], [[iteration]]

we can improve an initial guess $x_0$ of the root of a [[function]] $f$ by iterating $x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{f\ x_n}{f'\ x_n}$ until some tolerance is met

> **note** $x_{n + 1}$ is just the x-intercept of the [[function#tangent line]] of $f$ at $x_n$
