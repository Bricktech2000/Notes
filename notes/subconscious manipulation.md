# Subconscious Manipulation

**see** [[psychology]]

a lot of "things" in this world seem to directly target our subconscious mind in order to trick us into making decisions we wouldn't have made otherwise

for deep [[focus]], it is essential that decisions we take are [[intention]]al and not the result of [[subconscious manipulation]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/SIsCy663mz4>

> **examples**
>
> - short-term [[credit card]] rewards trick a lot of people into choosing a worst long-term [[credit card]]
> - "would you like ... today?" questions often make people react in a _why not?_ manner, even though they did not plan on buying the additional [[goods and services]]
> - when one runs out of storage on Google Drive, the platform offers the user a 1-month free trail of 100GB of storage. however, it is crucial to understand that having always had 15GB of storage is way simpler than having to go back from 100GB when the free trail expires. consequently, customers who blindly clicked the _accept_ buttom must continue to pay to prevent their files from getting deleted
> - "reward cards" that offer around 1% cashback, but still trick people's subconscious into feeling like the rewards are greater. this can be done by allowing the user to accumulate points so that when they redeem them, they get a semi-substantial amount of money (something like 20\$, even though they had to spend around 2000\$ to get those points with 1% cashback)
> - images on packaging are designed to look better than the actual product. they are different enough to manipulate people's subconscious but similar enough not to feel like deception
> - [[material distortion]]
