[[fact]]s are about _lower-order [[learning]]_, which can feel tedious and irrelevant; factual information often stays _isolated_ instead of being _integrated_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/TQXMl4GycD0?t=369>. [[fact]]s can easily get confused, but can be looked up quickly using reference books or search engines. [[fact]]s can be learned through [[mnemonic]]s or other [[memory technique]]s and through [[spaced repetition]] and [[interleaving]]

> **examples**
>
> - a date at which an event took place
> - the name of a bone in the human body
