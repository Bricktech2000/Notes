> **procedure** [[curve fitting]] can be achieved by choosing a model for the data (such as a [[polynomial]] or [[exponent]]ial [[function]]) and a [[loss function]] that measures how well the model fits the data. the parameters of the model can then be optimized using [[gradient#descent]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/vIFKGFl1Cn8>

## Coefficient of Determination

[[loss function]]s are not a good general measure of how well models fit data because they are not scale independent. the [[curve fitting#coefficient of determination]] is better as it compares the error in the estimates against the total variability of the observed data

**definition**

**`R2 = 1 . (:[y . y_*]2  --  :[y . \m]2)`**, where

- **`R2`** is the _coefficient of determination_ of the model
- **`y`** are the observed values
- **`y_*`** are the predicted values
- **`\m`** is the [[mean]] of the observed values

> **example** a model **`y_* = y`** will have an **`R2 = 1`** because the error in the estimates is **`0`** as the model perfectly fits the data

> **example** a model **`y_* = \m`** will have an **`R2 = 0`** because the error in the estimates is equal to the total variability of the observed data
