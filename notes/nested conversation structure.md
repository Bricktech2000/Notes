# Nested Conversation Structure

**see** [[math notation]]

conversations can be structured as a [[stack]] evolving over [[time]], onto which subconversations are pushed before being popped off when they are completed

this contrasts with "normal" conversations, which feel like mindless jumps around a free-form [[graph]] of topics

> **note**
>
> [[nested conversation structure]] is the natural way I approach conversation. whenever changing conversation topic, I instinctively and subconsciously mentally record a stack of ideas to ultimately be wrapped up
>
> during conversation, I occasionally find myself [[overwhelm]]ed because of the [[cognitive load]] resulting from keeping track of dozens of those loose ends. I make a small remark, which I see as a subconversation. then, before I wrap it up to continue on the main topic, the person I am talking with makes **another** remark on top of my remark. and then I might make **another** remark on top of **that** remark. in the blink of an eye we're 10 levels deep and I'm having a hard time keeping up
>
> that is usually the point at which I realize that the person I have been talking with is not planning on ever wrapping up previous ideas. in my mind, we're in the middle of a complex large-scale highly nested conversation. in their mind, though, we've just been changing topics frequently. when I realize that, I flip the switch over to _normal conversation mode_ and everything is fine from there. or I send them this note. if you're reading this note after I sent it to you, then hi! how's your day been?

- conversation **`0`**
  - conversation **`1`**
  - conversation **`1`**
    - conversation **`2`**
  - conversation **`1`**
- conversation **`0`**
  - conversation **`3`**

**representation** _as a [[stack]] over [[time]], growing to the right_

1. conversation **`0`**
2. conversation **`0`** &bull; conversation **`1`**
3. conversation **`0`** &bull; conversation **`1`**
4. conversation **`0`** &bull; conversation **`1`** &bull; conversation **`2`**
5. conversation **`0`** &bull; conversation **`1`**
6. conversation **`0`**
7. conversation **`0`** &bull; conversation **`3`**
8. conversation **`0`**
9. conversation **`0`**

**tradeoffs**

with [[nested conversation structure]], interrupting is not impolite and getting interrupted is not frustrating because both parties know they will have the opportunity to wrap up their argument when eventually popping subconversations from the [[stack]]

there must exist a mutual understanding between all parties for [[nested conversation structure]] to be effective
