> **examples** _[[trick]]s to form [[habit]]s_
>
> - habit stacking &mdash; stacking a new [[habit]] on top of an existing habit (stretching for 5 minutes right after brushing your teeth)

> - the two-minute rule &mdash; anchoring the routine before ramping up the difficulty (start reading by only reading one page a day, start exercising by only putting on your running shoes and opening the door)
