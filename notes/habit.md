# Habit

**see** [[system over goal]]

> **resource** _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear audiobook &mdash; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUm3fKk00J8>

**definition** a _habit_ is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly and in many cases automatically &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=725>

**definition** a _good habit_ is a [[habit]] with low short-term reward but high long-term reward &mdash; me

**definition** a _bad habit_ is a [[habit]] with high short-term reward but low long-term reward &mdash; me

_good habits_ are [[invest]]ments that compound over [[time]]. they seem to make no difference in the short term but make a huge difference in the long term, and this is why it can be so [[difficult]] to build [[habit]]s that last. a lot of people give up on their [[habit]]s before breaking through the _plateau of latent potential_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=2194>

[[habit]]s are our [[brain]]'s way to delegate an action from our conscious mind to our unconscious mind. they are all about [[cognitive load#reduction]] and increasing [[energy]] efficiency by recognizing simple [[cue]]s and associating them with a [[sequence]] of actions. technology can also be used to decrease [[cognitive load]] when using [[habit]]s is suboptimal &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=4599> from 1:16:39 to 1:22:08 and <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=16151>

## Loop

_the [[habit#loop]]_

habits can be broken down into their four component parts, called the _habit loop_:

1. cue &mdash; make it obvious or invisible
2. craving &mdash; make it attractive or unattractive
3. response &mdash; make it easy or difficult
4. reward &mdash; make it satisfying or unsatisfying

> **example**
>
> 1. cue &mdash; mind goes blank at work
> 2. craving &mdash; want to alleviate the frustration
> 3. response &mdash; check social media
> 4. reward &mdash; satisfy the need to feel less frustrated

## Formation

_[[habit#formation]]_

> **examples** _[[trick]]s to form [[habit]]s_
>
> - implementation strategy &mdash; phrasing habits as _I will [habit] at [time] in [location]_
> - habit stacking &mdash; stacking a new [[habit]] on top of an existing habit so the first becomes the [[cue]] for the second
> - environment design &mdash; designing your environment to make it more obvious to perform a [[habit]]
> - temptation bundling &mdash; bundling a [[habit]] you have to do with a [[habit]] you want to do
> - group influence &mdash; surrounding yourself with people who have the same [[habit]]s as you to reinforce them
> - decreasing friction &mdash; removing [[psychology]]cal barriers to a [[habit]] so it becomes easier to perform
> - brain reprogramming &mdash; reinforcing a [[habit]] by constantly repeating to yourself its pros xor cons
> - two-minute rule &mdash; anchoring the routine before ramping up the [[difficult]]y to make it stick
> - habit tracking &mdash; tracking a [[habit]] to make it more visible and to keep you [[accountable]] and [[intention]]al
> - accountability &mdash; having someone to report to about your [[habit]]s to keep you [[accountable]]; see [[commitment#device]]

## Tracking

[[habit#tracking]] can be thought of as providing the **timely feedback** necessary for [[learning]] and the [[accountable]]ility necessary for the feedback to **actively be used in improving** &mdash; me

[[habit#tracking]] can lead to the **introspection** required for [[self-control]]

## Keystone Habit

**definition** a _keystone habit_ is a [[habit]] that produces something of a ripple effect onto other [[habit]]s

> **example**
>
> > A few months ago, I started to notice a funny thing.
> >
> > When I worked out, I wanted to eat better. Even though I could have rewarded myself with chocolate bars and ice cream, I felt like eating real, healthy foods.
> >
> > I also slept better. And when I was awake, I seemed more productive. Especially in the hour or two after working out, when my mind seemed to think clearer and my writing was crisper. Thoughts flowed easily.
> >
> > When I didn't exercise, however, I was more prone to eating junk food. I would stay up later working on unimportant tasks. I started to feel tension in my back. I didn't check it, but my guess is that my blood pressure raised as a result of additional stress and no place to release it.
> >
> > In other words, fitness is the keystone habit the puts the rest of my life in place. When I workout, other things naturally fall into place. I don't have to think about eating better. I don't have to force myself to focus on getting things done. Exercise naturally pushes me towards my best self.
