# Habit

**see** [[system over goal]]

**definition** a _habit_ is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly and in many cases automatically &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=725>

**definition** a _good habit_ is a [[habit]] with low short-term reward but high long-term reward &mdash; me

**definition** a _bad habit_ is a [[habit]] with high short-term reward but low long-term reward &mdash; me

_good habits_ are an [[invest]]ment that compound over [[time]]. they seem to make no difference in the short term but make a huge difference in the long term, and this is why it can be so [[difficult]] to build [[habit]]s that last. a lot of people give up on their [[habit]]s before breaking through the _plateau of latent potential_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=2194>

[[habit]]s are our [[brain]]'s way to delegate an action from our conscious mind to our unconscious mind. they are all about reducing [[cognitive load]] and increasing [[energy]] efficiency by recognizing simple [[cue]]s and associating them with a [[sequence]] of actions. technology can also be used to decrease [[cognitive load]] when using [[habit]]s is suboptimal &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=4599> from 1:16:39 to 1:22:08 and <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=16151>

## Loop

_the [[habit#loop]]_

habits can be broken down into their four component parts, called the _habit loop_: `cue -> craving -> response -> reward`

> **example** `mind goes blank at work -> want to alleviate the frustration -> check social media -> satisfy the need to feel less frustrated`

> - temptation bundling &mdash; bundling a [[habit]] you have to do with a [[habit]] you want to do
> - group influence &mdash; surrounding yourself with people who have the same [[habit]]s as you to reinforce them
> - decreasing friction &mdash; removing [[psychology]]cal barriers to a [[habit]] so it becomes easier to perform
> - brain reprogramming &mdash; reinforcing a [[habit]] by constantly repeating to yourself its pros xor cons
> - the two-minute rule &mdash; anchoring the routine before ramping up the [[difficult]]y to make it stick
