_good habits_ are an [[invest]]ment that compound over [[time]]. they seem to make no difference in the short term but make a huge difference in the long term, and this is why it can be so [[difficult]] to build [[habit]]s that last. a lot of people give up on their [[habit]]s before breaking through the _plateau of latent potential_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=2194>

## habit formation

> **examples** _[[trick]]s to form [[habit]]s_
>
> - habit stacking &mdash; stacking a new [[habit]] on top of an existing habit (stretching for 5 minutes right after brushing your teeth)
> - reducing friction &mdash; removing [[psychology]]cal barriers to a [[habit]] (putting your shoes by the door for the next morning, putting a water bottle next to your bed to drink water first thing in the morning)
> - the two-minute rule &mdash; anchoring the routine before ramping up the [[difficult]]y (start reading by only reading one page a day, start exercising by only putting on your running shoes and opening the door)
