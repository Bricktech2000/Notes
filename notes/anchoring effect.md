# Anchoring Effect

_the secret weapon of sales and negotiations_

**definition** the _anchoring effect_ is a [[cognitive bias]] whereby an individual's decisions are influenced by a particular reference point or "anchor"

our mind often uses completely unrelated anchors to make decisions, such as the last digits of a phone number or of a social security number

> **examples**
>
> - a [[car]] salesman setting a high price initially for the actual price to appear lower
> - the **`150"$"`** dress at the front of the store that makes the **`50"$"`** dress at the back of the store seem like a bargain
