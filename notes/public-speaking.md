# Public Speaking

## Structure

be very explicit about the structure of a talk.

> "here's what I'll talk about and here is what you'll learn by listening. let's start with [...]. now, [...]. alright so that's all for [...]. let's now discuss [...]"

verbal punctuation can be used to convey structure. it also nonverbally tells people who fogged out it's a good time to join back in

link ideas together instead of listing them

### examples

- start with an empowerment promise. explain why people are listening to you
- when using slides, mention the title verbally instead of cluttering the slides with it
- use linking words when jumping from one idea to the next

### introductions and conclusions

introductions and conclusions similar to [[writing-a-report]]:

- start a talk by hooking people
- end a talk with an opening statement
- optionally wrap up each point with a small conclusion

## Nonverbals

### speaker confidence

look like someone confident and comfortable

- study the room beforehand to be comfortable with it
- walk around and look around to show you are taking up room
- show your hands and use them to demonstrate concepts
- be clearly passionate about the subject you are talking about (duplicate)

### artificial interest

trick people into being interested through nonverbals

- talk in a well-lit room to keep people fully awake and connected
- make sure the room is populated to make the talk seem desirable
- ask questions and [[rhetorical-question]]s to get people to engage

### empathetic mirroring

make people feel what you are feeling by exploiting empathetic mirroring

- write on a chalk board manually to make people understand the importance of a concept
- use real-life examples and anecdotes allow people to connect
- use props and strong visuals to enhance the empathetic effects
- be clearly passionate about the subject you are talking about (duplicate)

## Other

### facts

starting with a joke is not a great way to start a talk as most people are still settling in and getting used to your way of speaking. they likely won't laugh at it

after asking a question, wait around 7 seconds for an answer from the audience

flipping through slides can be too quick for people. the speed at which one writes on a chalkboard is approximately the speed at which people absorb information

saying "thank you" or "thank you for listening" suggests people stayed and listened out of politeness

### other tools

use repetition and examples to convey the importance of some information

build a fence around your ideas to distinguish them from somebody else's ideas
