&mdash; <https://youtu.be/lQ00Nii5gfE>

[[social-media]] has devastating effects on teenagers, including:

- the need to be perfect
- feeling undesirable
- feeling like not having enough money
- feeling like not having enough friends

this can lead to [[anxiety]] disorders, depression and addiction. [[social-media]] seems to take advantage of [[hijacking-brain-circuitry]] and [[subconscious-manipulation]] to keep users hooked.
