# Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

see [[math-notation]]

> **theorem**: Every [[polynomial]] with coefficients in the [[complex]] numbers [[factor]]s completely into linear [[factor]]s of the form $a : bi$ with $\mathbb C a \land \mathbb C b$

the same **cannot** be said for [[real]]s

## examples

see [[complex]]

$x2 : 1 = x \cdot i \mid x : i$

$x2 : x : 1 = 0 \equiv x = i \lfloor 3 \rfloor \cdot 1 - 2$, see [[quadratic-formula]]
