# Indicator Generalization

&mdash; initial idea by Daniel Tundun

[[indicator-generalization]] is the process of generalizing _indicators_, which allows people to make deductions about other people.

> **indicators** are generalizable cues observed in people. &mdash; me

indicators include:

- the brand of one's smart phone
- one's use of a specific operating system
- the brand of clothes one wears
- one's ownership of a diploma
- the make of one's car
- one's grades or the school one attends

## examples and consequences

even though [[indicator-generalization]] is an important part of social interactions, overgeneralization can lead to a number of problems.

university is sometimes described as a _diploma factory_, where students exchange a sum of money and an amount of time for a diploma. according to this description, the primary goal of universities has been shifting from "teaching students" to "giving out diplomas", as both students and universities know that the ownership of a diploma is a powerful **indicator**

resumes are, at their core, a collection of **indicators** that attempt to describe a person's professional skills. however, **indicators** can only go so far, and the more they are generalized, the less accurate they get. this means that someone's actual value can often be much greater than the value derived from their **indicators**. as job applications are more often than not submitted online nowadays, one's professional value is often derived from an overgeneralization of their **indicators**

> the kinds of invisible personal qualities that are so important got replaced with diplomas. you can be the most capable and qualified person around, and still get rejected because you don't have such-and-such degree and 30 years of prior work experience &mdash; Simon

as the brands of one's possessions are **indicators**, they can be used as a _status symbol_. this can be explained by the fact that the people one interacts with generalize their **indicators** to have a better idea of who they are. even though this behavior is essential to social interactions, it can lead to people spending more [[money]] on a good in order for it to be of a certain brand.

people often mistake generalizations of one's **indicators** for an accurate representation of one's personality and personal qualities

generalizations are convenient for people to use, but they are not always accurate.

## observations

indicator overgeneralization seems to occur to certain people more than others.

scratch that; indicator overgeneralization seems to occur at the outermost regions of a metaphorical bell curve. see [[intellectual-giftedness]], [[intellectual-disability]]
