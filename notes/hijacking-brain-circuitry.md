_unlocking rewards by unconsciously manipulating hard-wired brain circuitry_

the brain circuitry being hijacked is often related to our [[intent-to-mastery]]

> - seeing a vulnerable part of a popular streamer
> - having frequent live 1-to-1 conversation with the streamer through the chat. _you can talk to the streamer and they will respond to you_
> - inside jokes between the streamer and the audience
> - laughing and having a good time with the streamer
> - “remember when... ?”
> - some streamers calling their viewers their “besties” and telling them they “love them”

## Video Games

[[video-game]]s make the primitive brain circuitry of the player believe they are achieving something, where as they are arguably not. they release a relatively large [[amount-of]] [[dopamine]] (see [[less-stimulated-lifestyle]]) and makes the player go through a large variety of emotions.

some games, such as first-person shooters, make the primitive parts of the player's brain believe that events are happening in the real world, even though they are obviously in a simulated environment.
