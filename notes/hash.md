**definition** _A hash function_ is any [[function]] that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a [[hash]] [[function]] are called _hash values_, _hash codes_, _digests_, or simply _hashes_ &mdash; Wikipedia

**definition** a _hash collision_ is a situation in which two different inputs are mapped to the same [[hash]] value &mdash; Github Copilot

**properties**

[[hash]] [[function]]s are often optimized for a low number of collisions

[[hash]] [[function]]s are deterministic

**applications**

[[hash]] [[function]]s used in [[cryptography]]
