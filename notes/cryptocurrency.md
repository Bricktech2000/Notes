# Cryptocurrency

_a type of [[money]]_

see [[cryptography]], [[blockchain]], [[money]]

[[cryptocurrency]] is said to be _pseudoanonymous_ as a wallet is not tied to any specific person or organization, see [[know-your-customer]]

it is decentralized, meaning that a node going offline will not have any effect on the health of the network

## Coin VS Token

_[[cryptocurrency]] coins_ have their own [[blockchain]]. they are comparable to [[money]]

_[[cryptocurrency]] tokens_ are built on a coin's [[blockchain]]. they are comparable to securities, shares, tickets, and so on. they cannot be mined and their supply is known in advance
