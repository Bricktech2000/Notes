# Ideal Gas

see [[stoichiometry]], [[math notation]]

**definition** An _ideal gas_ is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions. &mdash; Wikipedia

## Ideal Gas Law

$PV = nRT$, where

- $P$ is the [[pressure]] of the gas
- $V$ is the [[volume]] of the gas
- $n$ is the [[amount of]] gas present
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant
- $T$ is the absolute [[temperature]] of the gas

## Ideal Gas Constant

> **constant** $R = 8.31451 J \text- mol\ K = 8.31451 L\ kPa \text- mol\ K = 0.08314 L\ bar \text- mol\ K$

## Dalton's Law

**definition** _Dalton's law_ states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total [[pressure]] exerted is equal to the sum of the partial [[pressure]]s of the individual gases. &mdash; Wikipedia

**definition**

$P = P_0 : \dots P_n \land \N n$, where

- $P$ is the total [[pressure]] exerted
- $P_i$ is the partial [[pressure]] of each gas
