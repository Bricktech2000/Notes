# Ideal Gas

**see** [[math notation]]

**definition** An _ideal gas_ is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions. &mdash; Wikipedia

## Law

_[[ideal gas#law]]_

$PV = nRT$, where

- $P$ is the [[pressure]] of the gas
- $V$ is the [[volume]] of the gas
- $n$ is the [[amount of]] gas present
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant
- $T$ is the absolute [[temperature]] of the gas

**constant** _the ideal gas constant_ $R = 8.31451 \text{ J - mol K} = 8.31451 \text{ L kPa - mol K} = 0.08314 \text{ L bar - mol K}$

## Dalton's Law

**definition** _Dalton's law_ states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total [[pressure]] exerted is equal to the sum of the partial [[pressure]]s of the individual gases. &mdash; Wikipedia

**definition**

$P_{total} =\ :\! P$, where

- $P_{total}$ is the total [[pressure]] exerted
- $P$ is a [[list]] of the partial [[pressure]]s of the gases
