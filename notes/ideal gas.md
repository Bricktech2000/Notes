# Ideal Gas

**see** [[math notation]]

**definition** an _ideal gas_ is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions &mdash; Wikipedia

## Law

_[[ideal gas#law]]_

$PV = nRT$, where

- $P$ is the [[pressure]] of the gas
- $V$ is the [[volume]] of the gas
- $n$ is the [[amount of]] gas present
- $R$ is the _ideal gas constant_
- $T$ is the absolute [[temperature]] of the gas

## Dalton's Law

**definition** _Dalton's law_ states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total [[pressure]] exerted is equal to the sum of the partial [[pressure]]s of the individual gases &mdash; Wikipedia

**definition**

$P_{total} = \,: P$, where

- $P_{total}$ is the total [[pressure]] exerted
- $P$ is a [[list]] of the partial [[pressure]]s of the gases
