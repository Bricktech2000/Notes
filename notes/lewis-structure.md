[[lewis-structure]]s are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule, as well as the lone pairs of [[electron]]s that may exist in the molecule. &mdash; Wikipedia

bonds between atoms $A$ and $B$ are represented as follows in a [[lewis-structure]]:

> **notation**: _single bond_ $A - B$ ($A : B$)

> **notation**: _double bond_ $A = B$

> **notation**: _triple bond_ $A \equiv B$
