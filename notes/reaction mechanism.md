# Reaction Mechanism

see [[reaction rate]], [[equilibrium]]

## Elementary Steps

they are the reactions that make up a mechanism

in an elementary step, partial orders (reaction orders) are equal to the [[stoichiometry]]c coefficients (see [[reaction rate]])

### Molecularity

_the number of reactants present in the elementary step_

- unimolecular
- bimolecular
- termolecular

### Rate-Determining Step

the slowest elementary step in a mechanism determines its [[reaction rate]]

- if the fist step is a fast [[equilibrium]], then the rate-determining step is the second step
- otherwise, the first step is the rate-determining step
