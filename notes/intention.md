# Intention

_purposefulness and thoughtfulness in one's actions_

**see** [[system over goal]], [[subconscious manipulation]]

Ryder Carroll defines an _intention_ as a [[commitment]] to a process, the organizing principle behind [[goal]]s and [[system]]s, and _intentionality_ as the alignment of one's actions with one's values by putting intentions into action &mdash; <https://youtu.be/Duo7OB3NEQg?t=5m18s>

the small gains [[intention]]ality provides are an [[invest]]ment that compound over [[time]] through [[exponential growth]]

[[intention]]ality is present-focused as opposed to future-focused; being [[intention]]al is about the small choices being made **here and now**

being [[intention]]al about where we spend our [[energy]] and attention can reduce stress and [[anxiety]]

being [[intention]]al about where we spend our [[time]] can improve [[productivity]] and reduce wasted [[time]]
