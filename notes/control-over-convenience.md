# Control over Convenience

as a general rule, I seem to prefer control over convenience.

### examples

- FPV drones over DJI drones
- laptop and phone sleep timeout set to _never_
- Android’s flexibility over iOS’ simplicity

### counterexamples

- point-and-shoot cameras are more convenient than professional cameras
- paddle shifter transmissions are more convenient than manual transmissions
