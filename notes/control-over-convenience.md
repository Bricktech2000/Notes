# Control over Convenience

as a general rule, I seem to prefer control over convenience. it is often very frustrating to me when only the _convenience_ option is available, but it is inconvenient at worst when only the _control_ option is available.

> **examples** _where I prefer control_
>
> - FPV drones over DJI drones
> - device sleep timeouts set to _never_ over automatic sleep
> - Android’s flexibility over iOS’ simplicity
> - Nutrition facts table over Mexico's warning labels

> **examples** _where I prefer convenience &mdash; with rationale_
>
> - point-and-shoot cameras are more convenient than professional cameras &mdash; however, good point-and-shoot cameras offer professional features
> - paddle shifter transmissions are more convenient than manual transmissions &mdash; however, paddle shifter transmissions don't sacrifice control
