# Catenary

## definition

[[catenary]]es can be defined mathematically as follows:

$y = a \cosh x\text-a$, where

$(x, y)$ is a point on the [[catenary]]

$\cosh$ is a [[hyperbolic-function]]

## properties

all [[catenary]] curves are [[similar]] as changing the parameter $a$ is equivalent to a uniform scaling of the curve

## examples

a string makes a [[catenary]] when it is held on its ends and subject to gravitational [[acceleration]]

[[catenary]]es are the perfect curve for a line segment to roll on

inverted [[catenary]]es are used in the design of bridges and arches so that [[force]]s do not result in bending moments

> **note**: a [[catenary]] can look similar to a parabola but isn't a parabola
