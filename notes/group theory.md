# Group Theory

**see** [[group]]

there appears to be a standard way to build [[number]] systems. [[group theory]] is all about formalizing this observation

> **examples** _number systems_

> - [[integer]]s $\mathbb Z$
> - [[complex]] numbers $\mathbb C$
> - hamiltonians
> - finite [[field]]s
> - [[p-adic]] numbers
