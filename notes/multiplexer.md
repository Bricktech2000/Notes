# Multiplexer

**see** [[math notation]], [[binary decoder]]

**definition** [...] a _multiplexer_ is a [[logic circuit]] that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as _select lines_. a [[multiplexer]] of **`2[n]`** inputs has **`n`** select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output

a [[multiplexer]] can be built with a [[binary decoder]] and a set of tri-state buffers
