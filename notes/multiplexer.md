# Multiplexer

**see** [[math notation]]

**definition** [...] a _multiplexer_ is a [[logic circuit]] that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as _select lines_. a [[multiplexer]] of $2[n]$ inputs has $n$ select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output

_a [[multiplexer]] can be built by using a [[binary decoder]] and a set of AND [[logic gate]]s at its input_
