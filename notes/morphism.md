# Morphism

## Homomorphism

**definition** a _homomorphism_ is a structure-preserving [[function]] ("map") between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type

**definition** a _homomorphism_ is a [[function]] **`f`** such that **``f (a`b) == f {a`b} > S {a /\ b}``**

> **example** `len` is a [[morphism#homomorphism]] between the [[monoid]]s `List, ++, []` and `Nat, +, 0`

> **example** a [[linear transformation]] is a [[morphism#homomorphism]] between [[vector space]]s

## Isomorphism

**definition** an _isomorphism_ is a structure-preserving [[function#bijective function]] between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type

**definition** an _isomorphism_ is an invertible [[morphism#homomorphism]]

> **example** **`[.] ee`** and its inverse **`\./ ee`** are [[morphism#isomorphism]]s between the [[group]]s **`ZZ, {:}`** and **`ZZ, {|}`**

> **example** an invertible [[linear transformation]] is an [[morphism#isomorphism]] between [[vector space]]s

## Endomorphism

**definition** an _endomorphism_ is a [[morphism#homomorphism]] from a [[algebraic structure]] to itself

> **example** **`ss`** is an [[morphism#endomorphism]] of the [[monoid]] **`NN, {:}`**

> **example** a [[linear transformation]] from a [[vector space]] to itself is an [[morphism#endomorphism]]

## Automorphism

**definition** an _automorphism_ is a [[morphism#isomorphism]] from a [[algebraic structure]] to itself

**definition** an _automorphism_ is a [[morphism#isomorphism]] that is also a [[morphism#endomorphism]]

**definition** an _automorphism_ is an invertible [[morphism#endomorphism]]

> **example** **`(..)`** is an [[morphism#automorphism]] of the [[group]] **`ZZ, {:}`**

> **example** an invertible [[linear transformation]] from a [[vector space]] to itself is an [[morphism#automorphism]]

## Monomorphism

**definition** a _monomorphism_ is an injective [[morphism#homomorphism]]

**definition** a _monomorphism_ is a structure-preserving [[function#injective function]] between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type

## Epimorphism

**definition** an _epimorphism_ is a surjective [[morphism#homomorphism]]

**definition** an _epimorphism_ is a structure-preserving [[function#surjective function]] between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same type
