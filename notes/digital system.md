# Digital System

_digital systems_ and _analog systems_ are children of _electronic systems_

a [[digital system]] is **not** necessarily [[binary]]; with that said, [[binary]] has a high noise tolerance, and it is easy to implement [[boolean algebra]] through [[logic gate]]s

[[digital system]]s are implemented using [[logic circuit]]

[[digital system]]s often store negative [[integer]]s in their [[complement#radix complement]] forms, but can also use [[sign-magnitude notation]]
