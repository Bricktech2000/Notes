# Digital System

_digital systems_ and _analog systems_ are children of _electronic systems_

a [[digital system]] is **not** necessarily [[binary]], though binary is most common due to its simplicity and high noise tolerance

[[digital system]]s are implemented using [[logic circuit]]s

[[digital system]]s may store negative [[integer]]s with [[complement#radix complement]]s or with [[sign-magnitude notation]]
