# Lewis Structure

see [[molecular geometry]]

**definition** [[lewis structure]]s are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule, as well as the lone pairs of [[electron]]s that may exist in the molecule. &mdash; Wikipedia

[[bond]]s between two atoms $A$ and $B$ are represented as follows in a [[lewis structure]]:

- $A - B$ (or $A : B$) for single bonds
- $A = B$ for double bonds
- $A \equiv B$ for triple bonds
