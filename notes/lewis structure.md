# Lewis Structure

**see** [[molecular geometry]]

**definition** [[lewis structure]]s are diagrams that show the [[bond]]ing between [[atom]]s of a [[molecule]], as well as the lone pairs of [[electron]]s that may exist in the [[molecule]]. &mdash; Wikipedia

[[bond]]s between two [[atom]]s **`A`** and **`B`** are represented as follows in a [[lewis structure]]:

- _A &minus; B_ (or _A : B_) for single [[bond]]s
- _A = B_ for double [[bond]]s
- _A &equiv; B_ for triple [[bond]]s
