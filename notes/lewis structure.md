# Lewis Structure

**see** [[molecular geometry]]

**definition** [[lewis structure]]s are diagrams that show the [[bond]]ing between [[atom]]s of a [[molecule]], as well as the lone pairs of [[electron]]s that may exist in the [[molecule]]. &mdash; Wikipedia

[[bond]]s between two [[atom]]s $A$ and $B$ are represented as follows in a [[lewis structure]]:

- $A - B$ (or $A : B$) for single [[bond]]s
- $A = B$ for double [[bond]]s
- $A \equiv B$ for triple [[bond]]s
