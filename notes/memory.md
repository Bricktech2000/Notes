interesting view on memory &mdash; <https://youtu.be/VQKt58kuEnk>

[[memory-technique]]s can be used as [[trick]]s to remember [[fact]]s better and faster

episodic [[memory]]es are formed in the hypocampus. damaging or surgically removing the hypocampus can damage both past [[memory]]es and the ability to reason about the future. a patient with a damaged hypocampus compared thinking about the future to being asked to "find a chair in an empty room". "the same machinery that brings all those pieces together to relive the past can bring some of those pieces together with other pieces to simulate possible futures"

episodic [[memory]]es are very flexible and can therefore be inaccurate or even manipulated.

## types of memory &mdash; with examples

- implicit [[memory]] &mdash; not requiring conscious thought, like riding a bike
- explicit [[memory]] &mdash; does require conscious thought
  - semantic [[memory]] &mdash; [[fact]]s, dates, numbers, words
  - episodic [[memory]] &mdash; personal experiences, dependent on context

## factors affecting memory &mdash; with explanations

- place &mdash; it is believed there are dedicated neurons in our brain to remember place and time related to a [[memory]]
- story &mdash; it is easier to remember something when it is part of a story, see [[mnemonic]]s
- emotion &mdash; [[memory]]es are more vivid and more detailed when accompanied by emotion
