# Unobvious Grouping

_categorizing items based on a hard-to-recognize characteristic rather than on an obvious one_

let some items that can be categorized in two different ways, **`A`** and **`B`**, and assume it is more natural or more obvious to categorize the items in way **`A`**. this optimal when an item with characteristic **`A`** is to be found. however, when retrieving an item with both characteristics **`A`** and **`B`**, categorizing the items in the less natural or less obvious way **`B`** is often more efficient

> **examples**
>
> - the natural or obvious way to sort Lego bricks is by **color**. however, it is easier to find a specific **type** and **color** brick if they are sorted by **type** instead. _finding a 2×4 brick in the "gray" section is inconvenient whereas finding a gray brick in the "2×4" section is easier_
> - the natural or obvious way to organize a refrigerator is by **type of food**. however, it is easier to find a specific **type of food** that will soon **go bad** if they are sorted by how soon they will **go bad** instead. _finding something that will soon go bad in the "cheese" section is inconvenient whereas finding cheese in the "will soon go bad" section is easier_
> - the natural or obvious way to organize a [[vim]] config is by **type of setting**. however, it is easier to find a specific **type of setting** pretaining to a specific **use-case** if they are sorted by **use-case** instead. _finding settings for window splits in the "keybinds" section is inconvenient whereas finding keybinds in the "window splits" section is easier_
