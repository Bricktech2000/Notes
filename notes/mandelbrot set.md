# Mandelbrot Set

**see** [[complex]], [[complex#modulus]]

**definition** _by induction_ the _mandelbrot set_ is the [[set]] of all **`CC c`** such that **`"abs"f`** is a [[sequence#bounded sequence]] given **`fss = [f]2 : c /\ f 0 = 0`**

**definition** _by [[iteration]]_ the _mandelbrot set_ is the [[set]] of all **`CC c`** such that **`"abs"f`** is a [[sequence#bounded sequence]] given **`f n = {z. z2:c}n`**

**representation** _in the [[complex]] [[plane]]_

> **note** the patterns that emerge from the [[mandelbrot set]] are unexpected and surprizingly beautiful, as if hard-coded into [[mathematics]] on purpose. yet, I would argue it is a coincidence that we find them beautiful; I would argue they just happen to tickle our [[brain]]'s visual cortex in a way we find pleasing
