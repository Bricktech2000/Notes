# Mandelbrot Set

**see** [[complex]], [[complex#modulus]]

**definition** let **`z c (n:1) = [z c n]2 : c /\ z c 0 = 0 /\ NN n`** be a [[complex]] [[function]]. then, the _mandelbrot set_ is the [[set]] of all **`c`** such that **`"abs" (z c)`** is a [[sequence#bounded sequence]]

**representation** _in the [[complex]] [[plane]]_

> **note** the patterns that emerge from the [[mandlebrot set]] are unexpected and surprizingly beautiful, as if hard-coded into [[mathematics]] on purpose. yet, I would argue it is a coincidence that we find them beautiful; I would argue they just happen to tickle our [[brain]]'s visual cortex in a way we find pleasing
