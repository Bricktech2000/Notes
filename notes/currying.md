# Currying

**see** [[function]], [[functional programming]]

**definition** _currying_ is the process of transforming a [[function]] that takes multiple arguments into a set of nested [[function]]s that each take a single argument --- GitHub Copilot

[[currying]] is just the [[type theory]]etic interpretation of $a^{bc} = (a^b)^c$, namely $A^{B \times C} \cong (A^B)^C$ aka $(B \times C) \to A \cong C \to (B \to A)$ --- me and <https://youtu.be/6hAeJmKXRfo?t=676>

from [[currying]] one may [[discover]] and not [[invent]] [[partial application]]
