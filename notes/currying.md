# Currying

see [[function]], [[functional-programming]]

> **definition**: _Currying_ is the process of transforming a [[function]] that takes multiple arguments into a set of nested [[function]]s that each take a single argument. &mdash; Github Copilot

> **example**: in [[conventional-math-notation]], we define [[function]]s as $f(x , y) = x + 2y$ and call them using $f(x, y)$

> **example**: with [[currying]] in [[conventional-math-notation]], we define [[function]]s as $f = x \to y \to x + 2y$ and call them using $f(x)(y)$

> **example**: in my [[math-notation]], [[function]]s can optionally be defined using [[currying]]

> **application**: [[currying]] allows for extending [[functional-programming]] patterns, which generally work on [[function]]s with only one input, to work on [[function]]s with multiple inputs.

> **application**: [[currying]] allows for [[partial-application]]
