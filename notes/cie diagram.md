# CIE Diagram

**aka** _CIE 1931 XY Chromaticity Diagram_

a [[cie diagram]] is a 2D [[chromaticity]] slice of the [[cie 1931#xyz]] [[color space]]. since the [[cie 1931#xyz]] [[color space]] can represent all colors that can be percieved by the human eye, [[cie diagram]]s are often used to represent other [[color space]]s visually

the [[color]]s on the outer edge of a [[cie diagram]] are spectral [[color]]s. generally, the [[coler]] with highest [[luminance]] is displayed for a given [[chromaticity]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/gnUYoQ1pwes?t=19m17s>
