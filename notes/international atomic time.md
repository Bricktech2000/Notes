[[international atomic time]] is a high-precision [[time]] standard based on the passage of _proper time_ on Earth. it is a weighted average of the [[time]] kept by numerous atomic clocks worldwide, the majority of which are caesium clocks; the [[international system of units]] definition of the second is based on caesium

[[international atomic time]] drifts away from [[coordinated universal time]] at a rate of roughly **`1 "s" -- "y"`**
