# Neural Network

**see** [[linear algebra]], [[optimization]], [[probability]]

**see** [[learning]]

**see**

[[forward propagation]]

[[backpropagation]]

[[loss function]]

[[activation function]]

## Training

[[neural network#training]] consists of minimizing a [[loss function]] through [[gradient#descent]]. the algorithm that computes this [[gradient]] efficiently is called [[backpropagation]]

## hello world

the "hello world" of neural networks is recognizing hand-written digits. the MNIST database contains tens of thousands of labeled hand-written digit images, which can be used for training &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w>

## differences with biology

the activation of neurons in a neural network is continuous whereas the activation of biological [[neuron]]s is [[binary]]
