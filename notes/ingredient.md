# Ingredient

## Sodium Nitrite

**aka** _nitrite_

--- Wikipedia --- Mitch Jerky

**notation** **`"Na""N""O"_2`**

improves the [[color]] of meat products, turning them red then pink. used as a preservative for meat and fish products

adding nitrites to meat has been shown to generate known carcinogens such as nitrosamines

_each **`50 g`** of "processed meats" eaten a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by **`10-188`** over a lifetime_ --- World Health Organization

## Sodium Erythorbate

--- Wikipedia --- Mitch Jerky

used as a preservative and antioxidant predominantly in meat, poultry, and soft drinks

increases the rate at which [[ingredient#sodium nitrite]] reduces to nitric oxide, facilitating a faster cure and retaining the pink coloring

helps the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines

## Soy Lecithin

--- Wikipedia --- <https://youtu.be/fQL16H9HRzg> --- Oreo Cookie

is both both hydrophilic and lipophilic. among other uses, lecithins serve as emulsifiers (used to form [[emulsion]]s)

## Sodium Bicarbonate

**aka** _baking soda_

**notation** **`"Na""H""C""O"_3`**

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate> --- <https://youtu.be/fQL16H9HRzg> --- Oreo Cookie

used as a leavening agent in baking. it is alkaline, and reacts with acids to form carbon dioxide gas

## Calcium Dihydrogen Phosphate

**aka** _calcium phosphate_, _monocalcium phosphate_

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocalcium_phosphate> --- <https://youtu.be/fQL16H9HRzg> --- Oreo Cookie and Gerber Snacks for Baby

used as a leavening agent in baking. it is acidic, and reacts with bases to form carbon dioxide gas, salt, and water

## Disodium Pyrophosphate

**aka** _sodium acid pyrophosphate_

--- Wikipedia --- Gerber Snacks for Baby

a popular leavening agent. combines with [[ingredient#sodium bicarbonate]] to release carbon dioxide gas

speeds up the conversion of [[ingredient#sodium nitrite]] to nitrites, which in turn speeds up the curing process

can leave a slightly bitter aftertaste that can be masked by using sufficient [[ingredient#sodium bicarbonate]] and by adding a source of sugar or flavorings

## Ammonium Bicarbonate

**aka** _hartshorn_, _hornsalt_

a leavening agent. produces more gas than [[ingredient#sodium bicarbonate]] for the same amount of agent. does not leave a soapy or salty taste as it completely decomposes into water and gaseous products

can often be replaced by [[ingredient#sodium bicarbonate]] or baking powder. cannot be used for moist, bulky baked goods such as bread or cakes as ammonia will get trapped in the dough, causing an unpleasant taste

## Niacin

**aka** _nicotinic acid_, _vitamin B3_

## Thiamine

**aka** _thiamin_, _vitamin B1_

--- Wikipedia --- Gerber Snacks for Baby
