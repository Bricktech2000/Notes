&mdash; <https://youtu.be/EbPy-8KFk54>

developers who actually outproduce other developers by a factor of $10$ don't really exist. however, [[10x developper]]s defined as _a developer who can solve complicated problems faster and in a superior way than others_ do exist. a [[10x developper]] should be characterized not by the _amount_ they produce, but rather by _what_ they produce

large companies are often looking for [[10x developper]]s
