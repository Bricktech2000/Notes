**properties**

[[engineering requirement]]s must form a complete sentence

the subject of the sentence must be the system under discussion

the verb is to be one of _shall_ &bull; _must_ &bull; _will_ to show mandatory requirements or _should_ &bull; _may_ &bull; _can_ to show optional requirements

every [[engineering requirement]] must provide a specific end [[goal]] and be measurable

words open to interpretation such as _usually_ &bull; _generally_ &bull; _typically_ &bull; _user-friendly_ are to be avoided

wishful terms such as _100% reliable_ &bull; _safe_ &bull; _handle all failures_ are to be avoided
