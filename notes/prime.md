# Prime

**see** [[math notation]], [[psi function]]

**definition** a [[number]] `n` is called _prime_ if and only if **`# yy n = 1`**; it follows that the [[set]] of [[prime]]s is **`n -> (# yy n = 1)`**

## computing primeness

let **`pp n`** be the number of [[prime]]s at most **`n`**. then, **`pp n -- n {n -> @@} = 0`**, see sources below. consequently, as **`n`** approaches **`@@`**, the [[predicate]] **`p -> __`** computes primeness of [[natural]]s in the [[interval]] **`* -| n`** with an accuracy approaching **`1-1`**
