# Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

**see** [[math notation]], [[complex]], [[factor]], [[quadratic formula]]

> **theorem** _Fundamental Theorem of Algebra_
>
> the following are equivalent:
>
> - every single-variable [[polynomial]] with [[complex]] coefficients has at least one [[complex]] [[function#root]]
> - the [[field]] of [[complex]] numbers is _algebraically closed_
> - every single-variable [[polynomial]] of degree **`n`** with [[complex]] coefficients has exactly **`n`** [[complex]] [[function#root]]s (counted with [[multiplicity]])
>
> more generally,
>
> - an **`n`**th degree [[polynomial]] equation over a [[field]] has at most **`n`** solutions

the same **cannot** be said for [[real]]s

**examples**

> **example** **`x2 : 1 = x .. ii | x : ii`**

> **example** **`x2 : x : 1 = 0 == x = ii \3/ .. 1 -- 2`**
