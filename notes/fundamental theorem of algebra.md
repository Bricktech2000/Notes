# Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

**see** [[math notation]], [[complex]], [[factor]], [[quadratic formula]]

> **theorem**: _Fundamental Theorem of Algebra_
>
> the following are equivalent:
>
> - every single-variable [[polynomial]] with [[complex]] coefficients has at least one [[complex]] root
> - the [[field]] of [[complex]] numbers is _algebraically closed_
> - every single-variable [[polynomial]] of degree $n$ with [[complex]] coefficients has exactly $n$ [[complex]] roots (counted with [[multiplicity]])
>
> more generally,
>
> - an $n$ th degree [[polynomial]] equation over a [[field]] has at most $n$ solutions

the same **cannot** be said for [[real]]s

**examples**

> **example** $x2 : 1 = x \cdot \iota \mid x : \iota$

> **example** $x2 : x : 1 = 0 =\!= x = \iota \lfloor 3 \rfloor \cdot 1 - 2$
