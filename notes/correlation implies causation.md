# Correlation Implies Causation

**definition** _correlation implies causation_ is a [[cognitive bias]] characterized by the belief that a correlation between two variables implies a cause-and-effect relationship between them &mdash; Wikipedia and me

[[correlation implies causation]] is a _logical fallacy_ &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation>

**examples**

> **example**
>
> there exists a correlation between eating ice cream and getting a sunburn. however, it is not the case that eating ice cream causes sunburns; it is not the case that [[correlation implies causation]].

>   A(Sunny Summer Weather)
>   B(Eating Ice Cream)
>   C(Getting a Sunburn)
>   A --> B
