# Nested Recipe Structure

--- initial idea by Kiera

principles of [[nested recipe structure]] are as follows:

- synchronous steps have different indentation levels; asynchronous steps have identical indentation levels
- "subrecipes" are indented and placed above their parent step so the recipe can still be read top to bottom
- [[ingredient]] quantities are included directly in the step in which they are used

> **example** _Cajun Shrimp and Sausage Rice_
>
> - - in a large stockpot over medium heat, heat **1 tbsp olive oil** until shimmering. cook **8 oz sweet Italian sausage links** until browned and cooked through. transfer them to a plate and tent with aluminum foil
>     - chop **1 cup onion**, **1/2 cup bell pepper** and **1/2 cup celery**
>   - in a large stockpot over medium heat, add the onion, pepper and celery and cook for 5 minutes, stirring and scraping up any brown bits. add **2 cups white rice** and cook until the rice starts to appear opaque, another 3 to 5 minutes.
>     stir in **2 tbsp Cajun spice blend** and then add **4 cups chicken stock**, scraping up any brown bits. bring the mixture to a low boil. reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes
>     - thaw, peel and devein **8 oz medium shrimp**
>   - in a pan, heat **1 tsp olive oil** until shimmering. add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink, about 5 minutes
> - slice the sausages. incorporate the shrimp, sausages and rice into the pot. cover and cook until the rice is tender and the shrimp are pink, another 10 to 15 minutes

**tradeoffs**

- no need to refer to [[ingredient]]s list when cooking as quantities are included in the step in which they are used
- improved structure allows for easy visualization of the recipe at a glance
- someone who does not understand the structure can still follow the recipe by reading it from top to bottom
- easy to understand the purpose of an [[ingredient]]

- buying [[ingredient]]s can be more time-consuming for people using [[ingredient]]s lists as shopping lists
