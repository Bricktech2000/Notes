the [[benign violation]] theory stipulates that humor occurs when and only when a situation is **simultaneously** perceived as **benign** and as a **violation**

> **example**
>
> - tickling a friend is a _benign violation_ --- physically threatening yet harmless therefore funny
> - tickling oneself is _strictly benign_ --- not threatening therefore not funny
> - tickling a stranger is a _malign violation_ --- not harmless therefore not funny

> **example**
>
> - stumbling down stairs is a _benign violation_ --- unexpected yet harmless therefore funny
> - walking down stairs is _strictly benign_ --- not unexpected therefore not funny
> - falling down stairs is a _malign violation_ --- not harmless therefore not funny
