> what is a model in FOL?

> In first-order logic (FOL), a **model** is a mathematical structure that provides a concrete interpretation of the symbols and formulas in the language, thereby determining their truth values.
>
> Formally, a model \( \mathcal{M} \) for a first-order language \( \mathcal{L} \) consists of:
>
> 1. **Domain (or Universe) \( D \)**: A non-empty set that serves as the range of quantification for the variables.
> 2. **Interpretation function \( I \)**: This assigns meaning to the non-logical symbols of the language:
>    - Each constant symbol \( c \in \mathcal{L} \) is mapped to an element \( I(c) \in D \).
>    - Each \( n \)-ary function symbol \( f \in \mathcal{L} \) is mapped to an \( n \)-ary function \( I(f): D^n \to D \).
>    - Each \( n \)-ary predicate symbol \( P \in \mathcal{L} \) is mapped to a relation \( I(P) \subseteq D^n \).
>
> A formula \( \varphi \) is said to be **true in a model** \( \mathcal{M} \) under a variable assignment \( g \) if it evaluates to true when all symbols are interpreted according to \( \mathcal{M} \) and the free variables are assigned elements of \( D \) via \( g \). A sentence (a formula with no free variables) is **satisfied** or **true** in \( \mathcal{M} \) if it evaluates to true under _all_ variable assignments.
>
> A model \( \mathcal{M} \) is said to be a **model of a set of sentences \( \Gamma \)** if every sentence in \( \Gamma \) is true in \( \mathcal{M} \).

> what is a model in propositional logic

> In **propositional logic**, a **model** is a truth assignment that specifies a truth value (either true or false) for each propositional variable in the language.
>
> Formally:
>
> - Let \( \mathcal{L} \) be a propositional language with a set of propositional variables \( \{p_1, p_2, \ldots\} \).
> - A **model** \( M \) is a function \( M : \{p_1, p_2, \ldots\} \to \{\text{true}, \text{false}\} \), assigning a truth value to each variable.
>
> This function extends recursively to all well-formed formulas (wffs) in the language via the standard truth tables for logical connectives (¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔).
>
> A formula \( \varphi \) is **true in a model** \( M \) if it evaluates to true under the assignment \( M \). A model **satisfies** a formula \( \varphi \) if \( M(\varphi) = \text{true} \).
>
> A model is a **model of a set of formulas** \( \Gamma \) if it satisfies every formula in \( \Gamma \).
