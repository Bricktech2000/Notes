# Software Engineering

_solving problems by the systematic development and evolution of high-quality software systems within time and cost requirements_

[[software engineering]] has very low development costs and is easier to reproduce compared to other engineering fields. development costs are high and production costs are low

contrastingly to physical products, software does not "wear out"; it deteriorates as its design and requirements change. [[programming paradigm]]s are one way to deal with this issue

**definition** _software quality_ is a metric that depends on usability, efficiency, reliability, maintainability and reusability
