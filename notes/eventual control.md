# Eventual Control

_in the beginning you want results but in the end you want control_

#xxx rename to _eventual control_? ie. `[[go]] doesn't give you [[eventual control]]`

- don't complain about complexity when in the _results_ phase; complexity exists because _control_
- maybe that's why the Gos and Javas of this world feel like toys. they don't give you eventual control
- [[muscle memory]]/[[abstraction]] gets built over complexity over time
- think about relationshipt with [[invent]]/[[discover]] and [[durability]]

as a rule of thumb, I prefer _control_ over _convenience_. it is often extremely frustrating when only _convenience_ is available; it is inconvenient at worst when only _control_ is available

choosing _control over convenience_ is an [[invest]]ment. with that said, the human [[brain]] is of great flexibility. _you disable sleep timeouts?_, they say, _but doesn't the battery get drained when you forget to turn it off?_. well, I don't forget to turn it off. **ever**. paying attention through my conscious mind has become unnecessary, meaning [[cognitive load]] remains unaffected. I turn my devices off without even realizing it, and, whenever I decide to leave a device on, I feel some tiny tickle I can't quite describe. the mechanism at play reminds me of that [[sensory augmentation]] leverages. I don't need to "remember"; I just **know**

> **examples** _where I prefer control_
>
> - FPV drones over DJI drones
> - sleep timeouts set to _never_ over automatic sleep
> - Android's flexibility over iOS' simplicity
> - _Nutrition Facts_ table over Mexico's warning seals

> **examples** _where I prefer convenience --- with rationale_
>
> - point-and-shoot cameras are more convenient than professional cameras --- however, good point-and-shoot cameras offer professional features
> - paddle shifter transmissions are more convenient than manual transmissions --- however, paddle shifter transmissions don't sacrifice control
