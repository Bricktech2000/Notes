# Trading

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/J3fAI3al08Q>

**see** [[sunk costs fallacy]]

trading on the [[stock market]] is done through a _broker_ who executes the trade on behalf of the investor

_time in the market beats timing the market_

## Strategies

### Fundamental Analysis

fundamental analysis assumes a level of irrationality in the [[stock market]] and seeks to take advantage of a stock that does not reflect the intrinsic value of a company in the long term

> **example** Warren Buffet is a well-known value investor who uses fundamental analysis to find stocks that are undervalued

### Technical Analysis

technical analysis uses data on past movements in stock price and overall market sentiment in an attempt to predict the future change in a stock's price &mdash; The Motley Fool. technical analysis is generally used by short-term day traders and swing traders. it is the stereotypical trading strategy, with fast-paced candlestick charts over five and a half monitors

### Behavioral Analysis

behavioral analysis emphasizes human [[psychology]] and [[cognitive bias]]es and seeks to take advantage of the irrationality of the [[stock market]]

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

dollar-cost averaging is a passive strategy which attempts to neutralize short-term volatility by assuming that the long-term trend of the [[stock market]] is upward. this is done by [[invest]]ing a fixed amount of [[money]] at regular intervals
