# Improper Measurement Scale

_using an improper scale for a measurement_

**see** [[math notation]]

this seems to be a common problem among the general public, and frustrates me very much

> **examples** _scale examples &mdash; with correct use, and example use_
>
> - [[gaussian function]] &mdash; for quantities with a [[probability distribution#normal distribution]], **`.2ss`**
> - pie chart &mdash; for quantities that add up to a whole, **`-5 : 3-10 : -2 = 1`**
> - [[logarithm]]ic scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a base
> - [[fraction]]al scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a whole, **`20-100`**, **`2 -- 10`**

> **examples** _incorrect scale uses &mdash; with correct use_
>
> - rating someone's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 10 &mdash; should use a [[gaussian function]]
> - comparing populations using a [[line]]ar scale &mdash; should use a [[logarithm]]ic scale instead
> - representing budget distribution with a [[fraction]]al scale &mdash; should use a pie chart instead
> - comparing prices with dollar amounts &mdash; should use a [[fraction]]al scale instead
> - representing [[probability]]es of precipitation with a percentage &mdash; should use a [[probability distribution]] instead
