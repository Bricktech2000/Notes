# Improper Measurement Scale

_using an improper scale for a measurement_

**see** [[math notation]]

this seems to be a common problem among the general public, and frustrates me very much

> **examples** _scale examples --- with correct use, and example use_
>
> - [[gaussian function]] --- for quantities with a [[normal distribution]], **`.2ss`**
> - pie chart --- for quantities that add up to a whole, **`-5 : 3-10 : -2 = 1`**
> - [[logarithm]]ic scale --- for quantities that are proportional to a base
> - [[fraction]]al scale --- for quantities that are proportional to a whole, **`20-100`**, **`2 -- 10`**

> **examples** _incorrect scale uses --- with correct use_
>
> - rating someone's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 10 --- should use a [[gaussian function]]
> - comparing populations using a [[line]]ar scale --- should use a [[logarithm]]ic scale instead
> - representing budget distribution with a [[fraction]]al scale --- should use a pie chart instead
> - comparing prices with dollar amounts --- should use a [[fraction]]al scale instead
> - representing [[probability]]es of precipitation with a percentage --- should use a [[probability distribution]] instead
