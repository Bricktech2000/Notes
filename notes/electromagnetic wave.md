# Electromagnetic Wave

**see** [[wavelength]], [[frequency]], [[energy]], [[electron]], [[photon]], [[speed of causality]], [[avogadro constant]], [[specific heat]], [[plank constant]], [[density]], [[math notation]]

a particle of light is called a [[photon]]

_generally, one [[photon]] ejects one [[electron]]_

## equations

**see**

[[wave equation]]

[[plank-einstein relation]]

[[photoelectric effect]]

### other equations

$E_T = E_{photon} \mid \#_\gamma$, where

$E_T$ is the total [[energy]] in the wave, see [[specific heat]]

$E_{photon}$ is the [[energy]] carried by one [[photon]]

$\#_\gamma$ is the number of [[photon]]s
