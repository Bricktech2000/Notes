# Color Gamut

--- <https://www.howtogeek.com/802159/what-is-color-gamut/>

**definition** the _color gamut_ is the [[set]] of [[color]]s of a [[color space]] that can be captured by a camera or displayed by a screen

[[color gamut]]s are represented in a [[cie diagram]] as a polygon or closed [[curve]], or as a percentage of a given [[color space]]

since most screens display [[color]]s by combining three primary [[color]]s, their [[color gamut]]s are often represented as triangles. however, since there are no colors outside of the [[cie 1931]] [[color space]]s, there is no way to represent all colors the human eye can see using a finite number of primary [[color]]s, as those primaries must be within the [[cie 1931]] [[color space]]s
