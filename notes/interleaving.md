# Interleaving

_[[learning]] by forcing us to understand instead of memorizing_

**see** [[active recall]], [[spaced repetition]]

**aka** _mixing_

[[interleaving]] is all about balance: switching too infrequently can make us fall back to memorization, and switching too frequently can make us lose [[focus]] and get distracted
