# Linux

_a family of open-source Unix-like [[operating-system]]s based on the Linux kernel_

## pros & cons

### advantages of Linux

> - It's FOSS (free and open source) which means you can see all of the source code and make contributions
> - 99% of servers run on it, so it's much easier for sysadmin to have the same OS on your local machine for testing and such
> - All of the CLI tools are mostly for it or are better on it
> - It can be updated without rebooting it on servers for better up-time
> - It allows you to customize your desktop environment, window manager, etc.
> - It can be installed on lightweight computers because it's smaller and requires less system resources (this is why ChromeOS and Android use it as a base)
> - It is often installed on IoT devices (e.g. on your toaster oven) because of the above
> - It's faster in a lot of cases
> - It's often used by pentesters and hackers because there are more tools available on Linux (specifically Kali Linux)
>
> and many, many more...
>
> Even Tesla vehicles run on Linux because of how reliable it is
