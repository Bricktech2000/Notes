## notation

see [[calculus-notation]]

in [[classical-math-notation]], with $\delta\ F\ x = \delta x = f$,

$F\ x\ \bigr|_{a}^{b} \dots = F\ b \circ F\ a$

## definitions

> **definition**: a _definite [[integral]]_ has its two endpoints present

> **definition**: an _indefinite [[integral]]_ has its two endpoints missing

> **definition**: an _improper [[integral]]_ is the [[limit]] as one or two endpoints of an [[integral]] approach either a [[real]] [[number]] or positive or negative infinity &mdash; Wikipedia
