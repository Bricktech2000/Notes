# LUT

**aka** _look up table_

**definition** in [[color correction]], a [[lut]] is a [[map]] from a [[set]] of [[color]]s of a [[color space]] to another [[set]] of [[color]]s of that [[color space]]

[[lut]]s allow for relatively fine-grain [[color correction]] because they specify how each [[color]] or range of [[color]]s in a [[color space]] should be color corrected
