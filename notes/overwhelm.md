# Overwhelm

people feel [[overwhelm]]ed when they are unable to break down a [[goal]] into its component tasks &mdash; <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=9715> or when their [[cognitive load]] is too high. this is why [[system over goal]] is so important

feeling [[overwhelm]]ed can hinder [[motivation]] and can cause [[procrastination]]

> **example**
>
> if you tell a 5-year-old to clean their room, they will be able to do it. however, if you do the same with a 3-year-old, they will not be able to “[[focus]]” for long enough. in this case, however, not being able to “[[focus]]” is caused by the fact that the 3-year-old is [[overwhelm]]ed by the task. they cannot separate “clean your room” into its component parts: “put your books in the shelve”, “move your stuffed animals on your bed”, and so on. “Cleaning a room” is too abstract of an idea for them.
