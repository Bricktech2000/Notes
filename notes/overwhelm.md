# Overwhelm

**see** [[cognitive load]]

people feel [[overwhelm]]ed when they are unable to break down a [[goal]] into its component tasks --- <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=9715> or when their [[cognitive load]] is too high. this is a reason why [[system over goal]] is important

feeling [[overwhelm]]ed can hinder [[motivation]] and can cause [[procrastination#operational procrastination]]

> **example** if you tell a 5-year-old to clean their room, they will be able to do it. however, if you do the same with a 3-year-old, they will not be able to "[[focus]]" for long enough. in this case, however, not being able to "[[focus]]" is caused by the fact that the 3-year-old is [[overwhelm]]ed by the task. they cannot separate _clean your room_ into its component parts: _put your books in the shelve_, _move your stuffed animals on your bed_, and so on. _Cleaning a room_ is too abstract of an idea for them.
