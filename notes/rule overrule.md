# Rule Overrule

_all rules are rules of thumb_

rules are [[trick]]s for decision-making; they are generally short and concise, at the expense of the intricacy of reality. most rules are [[invent]]ed rather than [[discover]]ed

I believe that rules are meant to be broken: _all rules are rules of thumb_. [[rule overrule]]s are manifestations of this idea. as one develops experience and sofistication, rules begin to blur down into guidelines, eventually becoming undistinguishable from noise
