# Empathy by Inversion

it can be easier to empathize with someone not by imagining what it would feel like to be in their shoes, but rather by imagining what environment would make us feel the way their environment makes them feel &mdash; me

> **examples**
>
> - homosexuality &mdash; someone heterosexual imagining a world in which homosexuality is the norm instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be homosexual
> - [[wealth]] &mdash; someone in the middle class experiencing being surrounded by the poor instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be wealthy
> - [[intelligence]] &mdash; someone of average [[intelligence]] imagining interracting with people of low [[intelligence]] instead of imagining what it would be like to be of high [[intelligence]]

> **example** I go down stairs two by two. to empathize with people who are scared of doing that, I imagine what it would feel like for me to go down stairs four by four instead of trying to imagine being scared of going down stairs two by two
