# Dot Product

**see** [[math notation]]

the [[dot product]] is defined for any [[euclidean vector]]

**definition** **`:ab`**

> **note** if vectors are identified with row [[matrix]]es, the [[dot product]] can also be written as a [[matrix]] product &mdash; Wikipedia
>
> **`:ab = (0 -> a) | rr (0 -> b)`** #todo mm

> **example** **`:(3, 2, .1)(4, .6, 3) = 3'4 : 2'.6 : .1'3 = .3`**

> **example** **`:[]3 & 2 & .1[][]4 & .6 & 3[] = []3 & 2 & .1[][]4 && .6 && 3[] = .3`** #todo mm

**properties**

the properties of [[dot product]]s are the same as the properties of multiplication
