# Goal

[[goal]]s might not be the ideal way to progress, see [[process-oriented]]

## properties

_properties of good [[goal]]s_

[[goal]]s must be measurable with a clear endpoint. vague [[goal]]s are not goals; they're [[aspiration]]s

## example

an example of a bad [[goal]] would be:

> I want to be an athlete

this [[goal]] could be made measurable in different ways:

> I want to run at least 30 minutes a day (a [[process-oriented]] goal)

> I want to run a marathon in two years (a non-[[process-oriented]] goal)
