# Goal

**see** [[system over goal]]

[[goal]]s must be measurable with a clear endpoint. vague [[goal]]s are not goals; they're [[aspiration]]s

the best way of achieving a [[goal]] is often to focus on [[system]]s that will help you achieve it, see [[system over goal]]

## goals and risk

_philosophical thought on [[goal]]s_

### initial opinion on goals

I don’t like [[goal]]s as they feel like a reason to fail. I prefer not setting goals, as that way, nothing feels like failure. _you can’t fail if you don’t have goals_

### “the process”

let’s suppose I want to develop muscles; that’s the goal. arguably, the best [[habit]] to reach this [[goal]] is a daily visit to the gym. and that’s the mistake right there.

in order to stick to this [[habit]], I would have to learn to **appreciate going to the gym**. the end goal of developing muscles is not what should be focused on; instead, my main focus should be on **making the [[habit]] enjoyable**.

a few seconds is enough to realize that the [[goal]] that was set isn’t even reachable. no one will wake up one day and think: _alright, I’d say I’m done developing muscles now_. what’s worse is that this goal I would’ve set would’ve been to better myself, to better the way I feel about life. ironically, what would actually dictate the way I feel about life is the enjoyment of the [[habit]] itself, not the mirage that is this delusional goal.

> it’s all about the process.

### updated opinion on goals

_after a middle-of-the-night discussion with Grace_

[[learning]] to try to achieve a [[goal]], even though failure seems inevitable, is a valuable skill. failing to achieve a goal shouldn’t feel like a failure; rather, it should feel like an accomplishment.

you failed, so what? think about all the walls you powered through and all the marble statues you moved out of your way in the process (note to future me: the _marble statue_ metaphor is surface level; there’s nothing more to it, unfortunately).

as a side note, the [[goal]]s one sets must **feel achievable**. about half must be achieved, while the other must not. this ensures the full commitment of the subject to the goal. if the [[goal]]s one sets feel out of reach, the accomplishment-to-failure ratio must be increased to avoid burnout or feelings of powerlessness.

### quote that hit hard

> If they [gamers] believe that there is a chance that something won’t work, they actually avoid the entire phenomenon &mdash; <https://youtu.be/\_ZVGXmafWqY?t=171>

this kind of thought process can be part of the reason why someone is not able to move forward in life. people with an analytical mind think they know what will happen, which prevents them from taking risks
