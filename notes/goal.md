# Goal

[[goal]]s might not be the ideal way to progress, see [[process-oriented]]

[[goal]]s must be measurable with a clear endpoint. vague [[goal]]s are not goals; they're [[aspiration]]s

> **example** _good goal VS bad goal_
>
> an example of a bad [[goal]] would be:
>
> > I want to be an athlete
>
> this [[goal]] could be made measurable in different ways:
>
> > I want to run at least 30 minutes a day (a [[process-oriented]] goal)
>
> > I want to run a marathon in two years (a non-[[process-oriented]] goal)

**cons**

see [[process-oriented]]

- successful and unsuccessful people share the same [[goal]]s, so therefore the goal cannot be what differentiates winners from loosers
- achieving a [[goal]] only feels good for that moment in time, but then hinders longer-term progress as your modivation quickly fades afterwards
- [[goal]]s can create an _either-or_ conflict: either you achieve the goal or you don't, even if you were making progress in the right direction
