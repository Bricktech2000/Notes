## Money Multiplier

_the amount of money the banking system generates with each dollar it receives_

### definition

see [[math notation]]

$\text{money multiplier} = -R$

## Bank of Canada

### main functions

- issuing currency
- being the banker to commercial banks
- being the banker to the Canadian government
- coltrolling the [[money|money-supply]]

### power of banks

- increase or decrease the number of [[money]] in the [[economy]]
- can influence [[inflation]] to keep it stable

### tools for monetary control

- open-market operations
  - to increase money supply, the BoC buys bonds from the public
  - do decrease money supply, the BoC sells bonds to the public
  - quantitative easing
  - foreign exchange market operations
- changes in reserve requirements
  - an increase means that [[bank]]s must hold more [[bank|reserve]]s, increasing the [[bank|reserve-ratio]], lowering the [[bank|money-multiplier]], decreasing the [[bank|money-supply]]
- changes in [[bank|overnight-rate]]
  - modifying the interest rate of the BoC changes the [[bank|overnight-rate]]
  - a higher [[bank|overnight-rate]] discourages banks from borrowing from the BoC, thus reducing reserves in the banking system
  - changes in the [[bank|overnight-rate]] by the BoC are posted eight times a year, but it can also be changed at any time if extraordinary action is required

note that central [[bank]]s have no direct control over the amount of money that households choose to hold as deposits or that banks choose to lend
