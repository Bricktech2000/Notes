# Formal Charge

**see** [[bond]], [[math notation]]

**definition**

for any [[atom]],

$FC = FC_{atom} = \text{valence electrons} \cdot \text{lone electrons} \cdot \text{bonds}$, where

- $\text{valence electrons}$ is the number of valence [[electron]]s on a neutral [[atom]]
- $\text{lone electrons}$ is the number of lone [[electron]]s in the molecule (double the number of lone pairs)
- $\text{bonds}$ is the number of [[bond]]s on the [[atom]] (a double [[bond]] would have a value of $2$)

## Formal Charge of a Molecule

**definition**

the total formal charge must equal the charge of the [[molecule]] or ion. therefore, for any neutral [[molecule]],

$FC_{total} = FC_{atom_0} : \cdots FC_{atom_n} = 0 \land \mathbb N n$

## Preferred Formal Charge

**see** [[molecule]]

1. the [[formal charge]] must sum to the charge of the [[molecule]] or ion
2. a $0$ [[formal charge]] is preferred on an [[atom]]. otherwise, a smaller number is preferred
3. [[atom]]s with higher [[electronegativity]] prefer a smaller [[formal charge]]
