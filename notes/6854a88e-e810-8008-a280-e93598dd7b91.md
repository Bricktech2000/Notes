> what's a "high-validity environment"

> A **high-validity environment** is a context or domain in which:
>
> 1. **Cues reliably correlate with outcomes** – The information available to a decision-maker has a strong, stable, and predictable relationship with the correct answer or successful outcome.
> 2. **Regularities are statistically consistent** – The environment exhibits structured, repeatable patterns that can be learned over time.
> 3. **Feedback is accurate and timely** – The decision-maker receives clear, unambiguous feedback that enables effective learning and calibration.
>
> High-validity environments support the development of expertise through experience and are conducive to accurate intuitive judgments.
