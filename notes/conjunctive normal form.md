# Conjunctive Normal Form

**aka** _CNV, PoS, product of sums_

**definition** a compound proposition is said to be in _CNF_ if it is a _conjunction of disjunctive clauses_, see [[boolean algebra]]

the [[conjunctive normal form]] can be used to convert a [[boolean]] expression to exclusively NAND [[logic gate]]s by double-negating the [[boolean]] expression and distributing one of the negations. note that **`>< A == >< A /\ A`**, see [[boolean algebra]]
