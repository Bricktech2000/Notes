# Chrominance

**see** [[chroma]], [[chromaticity]]

**definition** _chrominance_ can be thought of as the "colorant" to be added to produce a [[color]] without changing its [[luminance]] &mdash; me and <https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/reu/ch1/signals/chroma.pdf>

the higher the [[luminance]], the more [[chrominance]] is required to produce identical [[chromaticity]]
