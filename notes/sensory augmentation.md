# Sensory Augmentation

**see** [[umwelt]]

_feeding information into the [[brain]] via unusual sensory channels_

as humans, we don't "miss" the world of smell a dog lives in as we have never experienced it. _we are firmly settled in our [[umwelt]]_

in the case of [[sensory augmentation]], **the brain** adapts to the signals sent to it, and so the signals do not have to adapt to the [[brain]]. _whatever information comes in, it just figures out what to do with it_. [[brain]]s are therefore general-purpose computing devices, and all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals to plug into it
