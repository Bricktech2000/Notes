# Sensory Augmentation

**see** [[umwelt]]

_adding new senses to the human body in a non-intrusive manner_

_feeding information into the [[brain]] via unusual sensory channels_

as humans, we don't "miss" the world of smell a dog lives in as we have never experienced it. "we are firmly settled in our [[umwelt]]"

in the case of [[sensory augmentation]], **the brain** adapts to the signals sent to it, and so the signals do not have to adapt to the [[brain]]. "whatever information comes in, it just figures out what to do with it". [[brain]]s are therefore general-purpose computing devices, and all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals to plug into it

**applications**

exampes of sending information to the [[brain]] through nonoptimal means:

- sirens of firetrucks and of police cars
- alarms, both audible and visual
- audible phone notifications and phone vibration patterns
- airplane cockpits full of gages and instruments

the examples above could be sent to the [[brain]] through an optimized channel using [[sensory augmentation]]
