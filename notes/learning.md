# Learning

_how things learn_

see [[memory]], [[neural network]] [[backpropagation]]

for efficient [[learning]], a system must **have access to feedback** that is a **[[function]] of the system inputs** and that is **timely and actively used in improving**

for a system to become talented at performing a task, the task **repetition-to-complexity ratio must be high enough**

> **examples** _efficient [[learning]]_
>
> - tennis players become talented by hitting the ball thousands of times and by seeing if the shot was good or bad right away
> - chess players play thousands of games before they become Grandmasters, each of which is either a win, a loss, or a draw

> **examples** _inefficient [[learning]]_
>
> - experts who predict political or [[economics]] trends can be worse than random chance as the highly complex situations they study have very low repetition
> - a gambler betting at the roulette wheel has bet thousands of times, but the feedback is not a [[function]] of the inputs as a roulette wheel is essentially random
> - radiologists don't improve much at giving diagnoses; they often don't get timely feedback on them and therefore the feedback cannot be actively used in improving
> - people responsible for admissions or employment can have a hard time learning patterns in ideal candidates as they often don't get timely feedback on their decisions

for humans to learn efficiently, they must practice **deliberately**; this is often referred to as _active learning_. they must practice in that uncomfortable zone the skills they haven't quite learned yet, which requires a lot of effort. a teacher can be very valuable for [[learning]] as they can point out weeknesses to consistently keep a student at the limit of their abilities

## Active Recall

_[[learning]] by retrieving information from your brain_

> **AKA** active retrieval, practice-testing

> **examples** _active recall strategies_
>
> - noting down questions instead of summaries and trying to answer them to learn (similar to the _Cornell method_)
> - using flashcards for learning [[fact]]s instead of using [[mnemonic]]s or other [[memory technique]]s

it seems to be believed that active recall sources its effectiveness from the fact that trying to remember information somehow reinforces that information, helping us learn it more effectively

I have a different theory, which is also the rationale behind making _Active Recall_ a child of the _[[learning]]_ note: active recall provides the **feedback** necessary for our subconscious to learn to store the right information. since our subconscious is trying to figure out whether we have successfully learned what we set out to learn, it must have access to **feedback** that is a **[[function]] of its inputs**, see [[learning]]. if it does not have access to said feedback, it assumes we have already learned enough and does not unnecessarily waste [[energy]] trying to learn further. following this theory, spaced repetition can be thought as **repeatedly** teaching our subconscious to store the right information, and [[sleep]] can be thought of as the **timely active learning** phase of our subconscious, where it consolidates memories as it erases what turns out to have low value

our subconscious batteling our willpower over [[energy]] efficiency can also be observed in certain types of [[procrastination]]
