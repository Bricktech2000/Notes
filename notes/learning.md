for efficient [[learning]]ing, a system must **have access to feedback** that is a **[[function]] of the system inputs** and that is **actively used in improving**

for a system to become talented at performing a task, the task **repetition-to-complexity ratio must be high enough**

> **examples** _efficient [[learning]]ing_
>
> - tennis players become talented by hitting the ball thousands of times and by seeing if the shot was good or bad
> - chess players play thousands of games before they become Grandmasters, each of which is either a win, a loss, or a draw

> **examples** _inefficient [[learning]]ing_
>
> - experts who predict political or [[economics]] trends can be worse than random chance as the highly complex situations they study have very low repetition
> - a gambler betting at the roulette wheel has bet thousands of times, but the feedback is not a [[function]] of the inputs as a roulette wheel is essentially random
> - radiologists don't improve much at giving diagnoses; they often don't get timely feedback on them and therefore the feedback cannot be actively used in improving
> - people responsible for admissions or employment can have a hard time learning patterns in ideal candidates as they often don't get feedback on their decisions

for someone to learn effectively, they must practice **deliberately**; this is often referred to as _active learning_. they must practice in that uncomfortable zone the skills they haven't quite [[learning]]ed yet, which requires a lot of effort. a teacher can be very valuable for [[learning]]ing as they can point out weeknesses to consistently keep a student at the limit of their ability.
