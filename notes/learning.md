# Learning

_how things learn_

**see** [[memory]], [[neural network]] [[backpropagation]]

**see** _learning techniques_ [[active recall]], [[spaced repetition]], [[interleaving]]

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/5eW6Eagr9XA>

for efficient [[learning]], a system must **have access to feedback** that is a **[[function]] of the system inputs** and that is **timely and actively used in improving**

for a system to become talented at performing a task, the task **repetition-to-complexity ratio must be high enough**

> **examples** _efficient [[learning]]_
>
> - tennis players become talented by hitting the ball thousands of times and by seeing if the shot was good or bad right away
> - chess players play thousands of games before they become Grandmasters, each of which is either a win, a loss, or a draw

> **examples** _inefficient [[learning]]_
>
> - experts who predict political or [[economics]] trends can be worse than random chance as the highly complex situations they study have very low repetition &mdash; <https://youtu.be/Zs9Tifup1Bc?t=102>
> - a gambler betting at the roulette wheel has bet thousands of times, but the feedback is not a [[function]] of the inputs as a roulette wheel is essentially random
> - radiologists don't improve much at giving diagnoses; they often don't get timely feedback on them and therefore the feedback cannot be actively used in improving
> - people responsible for admissions or employment can have a hard time learning patterns in ideal candidates as they often don't get timely feedback on their decisions

when [[learning]] through a biological [[brain]], other factors are worth considering:

- for humans to learn efficiently, they must practice **deliberately**; this is often referred to as _active learning_, and can be achieved through [[active recall]]. they must practice in that uncomfortable zone the skills they haven't quite learned yet, which requires a lot of effort. a teacher can be very valuable for [[learning]] as they can point out weeknesses to consistently keep a student at the limit of their abilities
- there is evidence that [[memory]] consolidation is highly dependent on getting a proper amount of [[sleep#rem sleep]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=2219>. this is why it is important to get enough [[sleep]] after [[learning]] new [[fact]]s or [[concept]]s
- [[learning]] can be seen as a [[habit]], in which case it is highly dependent on environmental [[cue]]s. see [[habit#formation]]
