## general conventions

see [[matrix]] and [[complex]] for examples of general conventions

### LaTeX

a custom syntax is used for all mathematical equations through my custom [[math notation]]

[[variable]]s are defined in separate lines using a _, where_ statement followed by a list

whitespace in formulas follow [[programming language]]-like conventions

[[international system of units]] units and chemical elements are to be written within `"`. spaces are to be added between the number and the unit

### Sections

capitalized headings are for [[concept]]s that can be linked to using [[wikilink#nested wikilink]]s and lowercease headings are for general titles

some constructs, such as definitions and proofs, are very common. they are to be written as follows in [[markdown]]:

```md
> **proof** _proof name_ this is an example of a proof used in a blockquote

**definition** _definition name_ this is an example of a definition used inline
```

and they are rendered as follows:

> **proof** _proof name_ this is an example of a proof used in a blockquote

**definition** _definition name_ this is an example of a definition used inline

the following headings are used in blockquotes:

- **note**
- **example**
- **procedure**
- **proof**
- **[[mnemonic]]**
- **constant**
- **equivalence**

the following headings are used inline:

- **see**
- **aka**
- **types**
- **theorem**
- **definition**
- **properties**
- **applications**
- **pros**
- **cons**
- **pros & cons**
- **representation**
- **examples**
- **procedures**

### italics, bold, sources

italics are used for [[trick]]s and personal definitions and to replace quotation marks

bold is used for emphasis; italics must not be used for emphasis

`&mdash; ...` statements are used for citing sources

HTML entities are used for any non-ASCII [[character]]s and for ellipses

### note system

wiki links are generally avoided in headings

a page can link to itself

note names are mostly singular nominal groups, and sometimes adjectives when more appropriate

line breaks are used exclusively for how they look in the render and never to make the source code more readable (which is why almost no single line breaks are used)

horizontal rules are occasionally used to separate a whole file in different sections

each page has one title-case first-level heading, which must correspond to the file name. occasional subsequent first-level headings must be preceded by a horizontal rule

file names are all lowercase and diacritics are removed from them

box titles are generated with <https://lingojam.com/BoldTextGenerator>

all internal links are denoted using `[[note]]` and `![[image.png]]` [[wikilink]]s, and all external links are denoted using `<https://example.com/>`

## presentation-style conventions

see [[vim talk]] and [[carbon language talk]] for examples of presentation-style conventions

presentation-style notes are viewed using Obisdian's _Start presentation_ feature

slides are seperated by using horizontal rules, `---`

headings and content can optionally be seperated using an HTML line break, `<br />`

personal comments and notes are to be written between `<?` and `?>` tags, and not between `<!--` and `-->` tags

level-3 headings are not used as they look too similar to level-2 headings on Obsidian. there can be multiple level-1 headings in one presentation

## other conventions

the [[graph]] in [[index]] is generated on Obsidian using the following settings:

```yaml
# if a property is not specified below,
# it is to be set to its default value

filters:
  tags: no
  attachments: no
  exisiting files only: no
  orphans: yes
groups:
  - query: '[[math notation]]'
    color: '#ffffff'
display:
  arrows: yes
forces:
  center force: 0.32
```

a screenshot of the [[graph]] is then taken using Obsidian's _Copy screenshot_ feature
