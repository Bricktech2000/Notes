# Hijacking Brain Circuitry

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=7038>

_unlocking rewards by unconsciously manipulating hard-wired [[brain]] circuitry_

the [[brain]] circuitry being hijacked is often related to [[intent to mastery]]

## parasocial relationships

parasocial relationships occcur when our brains are tricked into thinking that we have a relationship with someone, even though that is not the case

> **example** _Sasha Grey_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=7128>

> **examples** _items that should come at a certain "tier" of a relationship but can also be experienced through following someone_
>
> - seeing a vulnerable part of an online personality
> - having frequent live 1-to-1 conversation through the chat
> - inside jokes between a content creator and their audience
> - laughing and having a good time, _remember when... ?_ moments

_I think what [[social media]] platforms are discovering is that the stronger the parasocial relationship, probably the higher the user engagement_ &mdash; Dr K.

## video games

[[video game]]s tap into the [[intent to mastery]] by giving players a sense of progress and achievement, even though they are worthless in the real world

## social media

likes on [[social media]] platforms make people feel accepted and loved

## foods

junk food is usually high in sugar, fat and salt, which are all things that our [[brain]]s are hard-wired to like because, in the past, they were scarce and valuable
