# Reversal Cipher

--- me

**see** [[math notation]]

given two [[function#bijective function]]s **`f`** and **`g`** with identical [[function#domain]] and [[function#range]], the [[function#composition]]s **``e = `fg``** and **`` `e = `gf``** are [[function#inverse]]s of each other, forming the encipher-decipher pair of a [[reversal cipher]]

both the [[function#domain]] and [[function#range]] of **`e`** and **`` `e``** are identical to the [[function#domain]] of **`f`** and **`g`**. consequently, [[reversal cipher]]s are most useful when the [[function#range]] of the bijections is awkward to work with

> **example**
>
> the [[function#domain]] of touch-typing is a [[set]] of [[character]]s and its [[function#range]] is key positions on a keyboard. within this model, a keyboard layout setting is the inverse of touch-typing that keyboard layout, which is obvious given that **``a`b = {*} == a = `b``** #todo id. therefore, let us define:
>
> - **`f`** to be _[[qwerty layout]] touch-typing_
> - **`g`** to be _[[dvorak layout]] touch-typing_
> - **`` `f``** to be _[[qwerty layout]] setting_
> - **`` `g``** to be _[[dvorak layout]] setting_
>
> from the above we may deduce:
>
> - **``e = `fg``** to be _[[dvorak layout]] touch-typing on [[qwerty layout]] setting_
> - **`` `e = `gf``** to be _[[qwerty layout]] touch-typing on [[dvorak layout]] setting_
>
> that is, _[[dvorak layout]] touch-typing on [[qwerty layout]] setting_ and _[[qwerty layout]] touch-typing on [[dvorak layout]] setting_ are [[function#inverse]]s of each other, forming the encipher-decipher pair of a [[reversal cipher]]
