[[concept]]s allow for _higher-order [[learning]]_; conceptual informaiton gets _integrated_ instead of remaining _isolated_ --- <https://youtu.be/TQXMl4GycD0?t=369>. [[concept]]s are best learned using [[active recall]] and [[spaced repetition]] and can be reinforced through [[conceptual note-taking]]

[[concept]]s can be structured through a [[graph]], see [[adt organization]]
