**see** [[fact]]

generally, [[concept]]s are more important than [[fact]]s; once grasped, they stay with you a lifetime. when [[learning]] [[concept]]s, make sure to understand the difference between [[recollection vs recognition]]

[[concept]]s can be structured through a [[graph]], see [[adt organization]]

> **examples**

> - understanding the function of a bone in the human body
> - understanding why an event actually took place
