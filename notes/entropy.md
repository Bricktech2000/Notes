**definition** _entropy_ is a [[concept]] and measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty &mdash; Wikipedia

_entropy_ can be thought of as the "likeliness" of a system to be in a given state; highly likely states have high entropy while unlikely states have low entropy

low entropy and high entropy are generally uninteresting; transitions from low to high entropy can often be interesting

> **example** we don't use up [[energy]]; we transform [[energy]] and use up [[entropy]] &mdash; me

> **example** the amount of [[energy]] on Earth is relatively stable: approximately equal are the amounts of [[energy]] provided by the Sun and radiated back into space. what the Sun **actually** gives us is a stream of low [[entropy]]
