# Entropy

**see** [[energy]], [[information entropy]]

**definition** _entropy_ is a [[concept]] and measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty &mdash; Wikipedia

[[entropy]] can be thought of as the "likeliness" of a system to be in a given state; highly likely states have high entropy while unlikely states have low entropy. in physics, [[entropy]] is a measure of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate: **`S = k/WW\`** "Boltzmann's equation", where **`S`** is [[entropy]], **`k`** is the Boltzmann constant, and **`WW`** is the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate. but, what _is_ a "macrostate"? macrostates are in no way fundamental, and rather arise from the physical devices we humans happen to have easy access to; that is, [[entropy]] may be thought of as the **amount of information we lack about a system**. the more information we have about the state of a system, the more work we can extract from it

> **example** there always exist macrostates that turn a high-entropy system into a low-entropy system &mdash; <https://youtu.be/89Mq6gmPo0s?t=824>

the tendency of [[entropy]] to increase partly explains the existence of the _arrow of time_

"useful energy", [[energy]] with low [[entropy]], is called _free energy_ and can do work; "waste energy", [[energy]] with high [[entropy]], is called _heat_ and cannot do work

> **example** we don't use up [[energy]]; we transform [[energy]] and use up [[entropy]] &mdash; me

> **example** the amount of [[energy]] on Earth is in equilibrium: approximately equal are the amounts of [[energy]] provided by the Sun and radiated back into space. what the Sun actually provides Earth is a **steady stream of low [[entropy]]**

> **note** life is exceptional at increasing the [[entropy]] of its surrounding environment, so much so that I would argue it is worth considering **defining** life as any such structure. maybe with some requirement about self-replication or something
