# Incorrect Measurement Scale Use

_using the incorrect scale for a measurement_

see [[math-notation]]

this seems to be a common problem among the general public, and frustrates me very much

## scale examples &mdash; with correct use, and example use

- bell curve &mdash; for quantities with a normal distribution, $\circ 2 \sigma$
- pie chart &mdash; for quantities that add up to a whole, $0.2 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0$
- logarithmic scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a base
- fractional scale &mdash; for quantities that are proportional to a whole, $20 \%$, $2 - 10$

## incorrect scale uses (with correct use)

- rating someone's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 10 &mdash; should use a bell curve instead
- comparing populations using a linear scale &mdash; should use a logarithmic scale instead
- representing budget distribution with a fractional scale &mdash; should use a pie chart instead
- comparing prices with dollar amounts &mdash; should use a fractional scale instead
