**definition** _antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder defined by a chronic pattern of behavior that disregards the rights and well-being of others. people with ASPD often exhibit behavior that conflicts with social norms, leading to issues with interpersonal relationships, employment, and legal matters_ --- Wikipedia

[[antisocial personality disorder]] is one of the most unfortunately named [[mental illness]]es. _antisocial_ in this context means _against society_, not _socially awkward_. _antisocial personality disorder_ is the diagnostic term for what popular literature and criminology writings call _psychopathy_ and _sociopathy_ --- <https://youtu.be/gpjYtAB9i2w?t=444>

in a world where people default to cooperation, generosity and forgiveness, it can become advantageous to be nasty and manipulative---and that's where [[antisocial personality disorder]] is rooted --- me. [[antisocial personality disorder]] is a feature, not a bug; psychopaths are psycopaths by design --- me. when people with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] get called out they get super defensive, but people with [[antisocial personality disorder]] shrug it off, or might even feel sadistic delight: _"how cool, I'm a psychopath and I'm getting away with it" [...]---their whole life is about getting away with stuff_ --- <https://youtu.be/gpjYtAB9i2w?t=5211>. people with [[antisocial personality disorder]] routinely break moral codes, social codes, legal codes... they don't care what others think of them

[[antisocial personality disorder]] means:

- lack of remorse
- lack of guilt
- lack of shame
- lack of empathy
- aggression
- deception
- defiance
- irritability
- recklessness
- gaslighting
- betrail
- malice
- deceit
- cruelty
- manipulation
- exploitation
- irresponsibility

when psychopaths have a relationship with someone, it is solely exploitative. they might want sex, money, power, connections... sociopaths, in their unskilled way, may get into a relationship but remain cold and rejecting. the psychopath makes a better criminal because sociopaths are somewhat messy, sloppy, reactive. _the sociopath is the bar fighter. the psychopath will kill that same person three days later methodically_

psycopaths are:

- calculating
- manipulative
- exploitative
- malevolent
- methodical
- cunning
- articulate
- charming
- smart
- slick
- glib

sociopaths are:

- less socially skilled
- not as sofisticated
- not as glib
- messier, sloppier
- more reactive
