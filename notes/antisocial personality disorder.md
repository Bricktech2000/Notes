# Antisocial Personality Disorder

**see** [[mental illness]]

## Symptoms

people with an [[antisocial personality disorder]]:

- lack empathy and are unable to feel guilt or remorse (makes them most dangerous)
- often exploit other people to achieve their ends by lying, cheating, stealing, and manipulating
- are unable to form meaningful relationships with other people
- are often described as being _cold_ and _calculating_
- constantly break norms (moral codes, social codes, legal codes...) as they don't think they apply to them

## Biological Model

--- <https://youtu.be/gpjYtAB9i2w?t=3485>

there is a belief that people with [[antisocial personality disorder]]s have lower [[autonomic nervous system]] arousal. this means that under conditions of fear or threat, they don't get as aroused. it is believed that this [[autonomic nervous system]] under-arousal could be inherited

consequences include:

- they are more willing to take risks
- research shows they have a lower resting heart rate
- they can get into very dangerous thrill-seeking sports

## Treatment

people with an [[antisocial personality disorder]]:

- will often try to outwit or intimidate a therapist
- aren't motivated to change as they don't believe there is anything to change in the first place
  > **note** but there **is** nothing to change! [[antisocial personality disorder]] is a feature, not a bug. psychopaths are psychopaths by design
- will try and game the system instead of making progress
  > **example** when court-ordered to therapy, they may wait out the sessions and say something like _I don't need to say anything I just need you to sign that document saying I came here for 10 sessions_

## [[sociopathy]] vs [[psychopathy]]

sociopaths are not as socially skilled, successful, articulate, smart, precise, and don't manifest as "well put together" as psychopaths

when psychopaths have a relationship with someone, it is solely exploitative. they often want sex, money, power, connections...

sociopaths, in their unskilled way, may get into a relationship but still remain very cold and rejecting

the psychopath makes a better criminal as sociopaths are somewhat messy, sloppy or reactive (see [[reaction]]). _the sociopath is the bar fighter. the psychopath will kill that same person three days later methodically_

[[antisocial personality disorder]] is one of the most unfortunately named [[mental illness]]es. _antisocial_ in this context means _against society_, not _socially awkward_. _antisocial personality disorder_ is the diagnostic term for what popular literature and criminology writings call _psychopathy_ and _sociopathy_ --- <https://youtu.be/gpjYtAB9i2w?t=444>

in a world where people default to cooperation, generosity and forgiveness, it can become advantageous to be nasty and manipulative---and that's where [[antisocial personality disorder]] is rooted --- me. [[antisocial personality disorder]] is a feature, not a bug; psychopaths are psycopaths by design

- recklessness
