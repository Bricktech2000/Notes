> [...] for a given planar arc between two endpoints, there is at least one point at which the [[function#tangent line]] to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints. &mdash; Wikipedia

**theorem** let **`f`** be a [[function]] defined on **`a -| * -| b`** such that **`f`** is continuous on **`a -| * -| b`** and that **`f`** is differentiable on **`a {-|/\+} * {-|/\+} b`**. then, there is a number **`c`** in **`a -| * -| b`** such that the average rate of change of **`f`** on **`a -| * -| b`** is equal to the [[derivative]] of **`f x`** with respect to **`x`** at **`c`**, or equivalently **`f b . f a -- b . a = dd f c -- dd c`**

> **note** the number **`c`** above is not necessarily unique

## Rolle's Theorem

> Rolle's theorem or Rolle's lemma essentially states that any real-valued differentiable function that attains equal values at two distinct points must have at least one stationary point somewhere between them &mdash; that is, a point where the first derivative is zero. &mdash; Wikipedia

**theorem** let **`f`** be a [[function]] defined on **`a -| * -| b`** such that **`f`** is continuous on **`a -| * -| b`**, that **`f`** is differentiable on **`a {-|/\+} * {-|/\+} b`** **and** that **`f a = f b`**. then, there is a number **`c`** in **`a -| * -| b`** such that the [[derivative]] of **`f x`** with respect to **`x`** at **`c`** is zero, or equivalently **`dd f c -- dd c = 0`**

## For Integrals

_[[mean value theorem#for integrals]]_

**theorem** let **`f`** be a [[function#continuous function]] defined on **`a -| * -| b`**. then, there is a [[number]] **`c`** in **`a -| * -| b`** such that **`f c = ($ f b | dd b) . ($ f a | dd a) -- b . a`** &mdash; [[proof]] <https://youtu.be/HfACrKJ_Y2w?t=33143>

> **note** the [[mean value theorem#for integral]]s is the same as the [[mean value theorem#for function]]s, with the [[function]] being the [[integral]] **`$ f x | dd x`**. substituting it into the [[mean value theorem#for function]]s, we get the [[mean value theorem#for integral]]s.

## Corollary

_[[mean value theorem#corollary]]_

**theorem** if **`dd f x = dd g x`** on an interval **`a -| * -| b`**, then **`f = g : c`** with **`RR c`** on that same interval &mdash; <https://youtu.be/u4kex7hDC2o?t=433>
