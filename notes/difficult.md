_the importance of doing [[difficult]] things_

&mdash; me and <https://youtu.be/oYeZ3DGPqAA?t=352>

it seems that things we qualify as _[[difficult]]_ are [[difficult]] because they require us to use our conscious mind to overcome our unconscious mind, often seeking long-term benefits over short-term gratification

whenever something is [[difficult]], we should ask ourselves _why is this [[difficult]]?_ and _what is the benefit of doing this?_. answering these questions allows us to be [[intentional]] about our direction in life and not be manipulated by the short-term desires of our subconscious, see [[subconscious manipulation]]

#todo backlinks throughout notes: difficult, hard, etc.

> **examples** _difficult things &mdash; with explanations_
>
> - forming good [[habit]]s &mdash; they have low short-term reward but high long-term reward, which can make them feel [[difficult]] in the moment
> - [[learning]] techniques &mdash; they seek to make learning [[difficult]], but what that means is that our [[brain]] is being forced to use more [[energy]], which improves our [[learning]] and [[memory]]
> - "the last few reps" &mdash; the last repetitions of a set are the most [[difficult]] because they damage our muscle tissue the most, but that is how we grow our muscles in the long term
