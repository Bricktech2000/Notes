## costs of a car

most people do not realize the actual cost of driving a [[car]] --- <https://youtu.be/c2rI-5ZFW1E>

_car share_ can be an alternative to owning a [[car]] --- <https://youtu.be/OObwqreAJ48>

### capital cost

_scales with driving distance_

[[car]]s are ~~assets~~ liabilities that very quickly depreciate in value. excluding [[loan]] interest, a [[car]] bought for **`40 000"$"`** and sold for **`15 000"$"`** five years later will result in a yearly capital cost of **`5 000"$"`**.

Americans borrow an average of **`40 000"USD"`** for a new car and **`27 000"USD"`** for a used car through a [[loan]] (which is **ridiculous** in my opinion)

### insurance

_scales with driving distance_

varies based on the driver's age and driving record and the year, make and model of the [[car]]. might average around **`1 8000"USD"`** per year

### general maintenance

_scales with driving distance_

includes oil changes, rotating tires, car washes, and so on. roughly **`400"USD"`** to **`800"USD"`** per year

### registration

_does **not** scale with driving distance_

includes registration and emission testing, where applicable. roughly **`100"USD"`** to **`400"USD"`** per year

### parking

_scales with driving distance_

varies wildly and can sometimes be "free"

### gas

_scales with driving distance_

this is the only expense people seem to think scales with driving distance. varies wildly
