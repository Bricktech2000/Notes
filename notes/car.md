## costs of a car

most people do not realize the actual cost of driving a [[car]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/c2rI-5ZFW1E>

_car share_ can be an alternative to owning a [[car]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/OObwqreAJ48>

### capital cost

_scales with driving distance_

[[car]]s are ~~assets~~ liabilities that very quickly depreciate in value. excluding [[loan]] interest, a [[car]] bought for $40\ 000\$$ and sold for $15\ 000\$$ five years later will result in a yearly capital cost of $5\ 000\$$.

Americans borrow an average of $40\ 000\ \text{USD}$ for a new car and $27\ 000\ \text{USD}$ for a used car through a [[loan]] (which is **ridiculous** in my opinion)

### insurance

_scales with driving distance_

varies based on the driver's age and driving record and the year, make and model of the [[car]]. might average around $1\ 8000\ \text{USD}$ per year

### general maintenance

_scales with driving distance_

includes oil changes, rotating tires, car washes, and so on. roughly $400\ \text{USD}$ to $800\ \text{USD}$ per year

### registration

_does **not** scale with driving distance_

includes registration and emission testing, where applicable. roughly $100\ \text{USD}$ to $400\ \text{USD}$ per year

### parking

_scales with driving distance_

varies wildly and can sometimes be "free"

### gas

_scales with driving distance_

this is the only expense people seem to think scales with driving distance. varies wildly
