# Stoicism

**see** [[luck]]

the majority of people drift through life; that is, they do not have plans, do not have [[goal]]s, do not have ambition, and simply drift around getting pushed by the current. they are not in control of their lives. contrastingly, the remaining minority of people decide to [[focus]] on what they have control over rather than what they do not; that is, they steer their way around life. they never blame their circumstances, and rather focus on what they can do to improve their situation. they are in control of their lives

> **examples** _people who steer over drift_
>
> - self-disciplined people
> - people who are [[intention]]al
> - people who value [[integrity]]
> - confident and calm people

> **examples** _people who drift over steer_
>
> - people who instinctively scream for help
> - people who appeal to their emotions
> - people who resort to faith and [[religion]]

> **note** I think I might've been in the process of reinventing part of stoicism
