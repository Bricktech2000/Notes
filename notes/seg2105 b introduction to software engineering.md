prof name: Wassim El Ahmar

prof email: <welah096@uottawa.ca>

open-access tutorials and labs (we don't have to attend the lab / tutorial section we registered for)

will work on [[android]] application during labs in groups of 4 to 5 people that connects users with chefs who cook at home based on various criteria. labs cannot be done alone; they must be done in teams "to prepare us for the workplace"

don't have to attend labs but have to submit work

## q&a

will the [[android]] app be close-ended? will we have to use Android Studio? will we have to use [[java]]? &mdash; we will be forced to use [[java]] and Android Studio

how will the teams be formed? &mdash; students can form their own teams, and then a discussion board will be open for students who didn't find a team
