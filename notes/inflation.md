# Inflation

_an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy_

> **definition**: _Inflation_ is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected [[goods-and-services]] (see [[consumer-price-index]]) in an economy over some period of time &mdash; Investopedia

see [[economics]], [[math-notation]]

## examples

## calculating inflation

### online calculator

<https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/>

### using [[gross-domestic-product]]

$Inflation_t = GDPD_t \cdot GDPD_0 - GDPD_0$, where

$GDPD_t$ is the current [[gross-domestic-product]] Deflator

$GDPD_0$ is the base [[gross-domestic-product]] Deflator

### using [[consumer-price-index]]

$Inflation_t = CPI_t \cdot CPI_0 - CPI_0$, where

$CPI_t$ is the current [[consumer-price-index]]

$CPI_0$ is the base [[consumer-price-index]]

## correcting using inflation

$P_t = P_0 \mid CPI_t \text- CPI_0 = P_0 : P_0 \shortmid \text{Inflation}_t$, where

$P_t$ is the current price of an item

$P_0$ is the base price of an item
