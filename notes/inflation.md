# Inflation

_an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy_

**definition** _inflation_ is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over [[time]]. a quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected [[goods and services]] (see [[consumer price index]]) in an economy over some period of [[time]] &mdash; Investopedia

**see** [[economics]]

**examples**

> **example** _inflation rates_
>
> $2\text-100$ is a low to moderate inflation rate &mdash; Investopedia
>
> $85\text-1000$ is a high inflation rate &mdash; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPb9ebUQbs>

**procedures**

> **procedure** _calculating [[inflation]] using the [[consumer price index]]_
>
> **see** [[math notation]]
>
> $\text{Inflation}_t = \text{CPI}_t \cdot \text{CPI}_0 - \text{CPI}_0$, where
>
> - $\text{CPI}_t$ is the current [[consumer price index]]
> - $\text{CPI}_0$ is the base [[consumer price index]]
>
> alternatively, an online [[inflation]] calculator is available at <https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/>

> **procedure** _correcting prices using [[inflation]]_
>
> $P_t = P_0 \mid \text{CPI}_t \text- \text{CPI}_0 = P_0 : P_0 \text{Inflation}_t$, where
>
> - $P_t$ is the current price of an item
> - $P_0$ is the base price of an item
