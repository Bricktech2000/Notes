_an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy_

**definition** _inflation_ is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over [[time]]. a quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected [[goods and services]] (see [[consumer price index]]) in an economy over some period of [[time]] --- Investopedia

**see** [[economics]]

**examples**

> **example** _inflation rates_
>
> **`2 0-1000`** is a low to moderate inflation rate --- Investopedia
>
> **`8 5-1000`** is a high inflation rate --- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPb9ebUQbs>

**procedures**

> **procedure** _calculating [[inflation]] using the [[consumer price index]]_
>
> **see** [[math notation]]
>
> **`"Inflation"^t = "CPI"^t . "CPI"^0 - "CPI"^0`**, where
>
> - **`"CPI"^t`** is the current [[consumer price index]]
> - **`"CPI"^0`** is the base [[consumer price index]]
>
> alternatively, an online [[inflation]] calculator is available at <https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/>

> **procedure** _correcting prices using [[inflation]]_
>
> **`P^t = P^0 | "CPI"^t - "CPI"^0 = P^0 : P^0 "Inflation"^t`**, where
>
> - **`P^t`** is the current price of an item
> - **`P^0`** is the base price of an item
