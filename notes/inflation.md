# Inflation

_an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy_

**definition** _inflation_ is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over [[time]]. a quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected [[goods and services]] (see [[consumer price index]]) in an economy over some period of [[time]] &mdash; Investopedia

**see** [[economics]]

**examples**

> **example** _inflation rates_
>
> $2\ 0\text-1000$ is a low to moderate inflation rate &mdash; Investopedia
>
> $8\ 5\text-1000$ is a high inflation rate &mdash; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPb9ebUQbs>

**procedures**

> **procedure** _calculating [[inflation]] using the [[consumer price index]]_
>
> **see** [[math notation]]
>
> $\text{Inflation}^t = \text{CPI}^t \cdot \text{CPI}^0 - \text{CPI}^0$, where
>
> - $\text{CPI}^t$ is the current [[consumer price index]]
> - $\text{CPI}^0$ is the base [[consumer price index]]
>
> alternatively, an online [[inflation]] calculator is available at <https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/>

> **procedure** _correcting prices using [[inflation]]_
>
> $P^t = P^0 \mid \text{CPI}^t \text- \text{CPI}^0 = P^0 : P^0 \text{Inflation}^t$, where
>
> - $P^t$ is the current price of an item
> - $P^0$ is the base price of an item
