# Inflation

_an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy_

**definition** _Inflation_ is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over [[time]]. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected [[goods and services]] (see [[consumer price index]]) in an economy over some period of [[time]] &mdash; Investopedia

**see** [[economics]], [[math notation]]

## calculating inflation

### online calculator

<https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/>

### using [[gross domestic product]]

$\text{Inflation}_t = \text{GDPD}_t \cdot \text{GDPD}_0 - \text{GDPD}_0$, where

$\text{GDPD}_t$ is the current [[gross domestic product]] Deflator

$\text{GDPD}_0$ is the base [[gross domestic product]] Deflator

### using [[consumer price index]]

$\text{Inflation}_t = \text{CPI}_t \cdot \text{CPI}_0 - \text{CPI}_0$, where

$\text{CPI}_t$ is the current [[consumer price index]]

$\text{CPI}_0$ is the base [[consumer price index]]

## correcting using inflation

$P_t = P_0 \mid \text{CPI}_t \text- \text{CPI}_0 = P_0 : P_0 \text{Inflation}_t$, where

$P_t$ is the current price of an item

$P_0$ is the base price of an item
