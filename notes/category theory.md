there appears to be a standard way to build contexts in which we do [[mathematics]]. [[category theory]] is all about formalizing this observation

[[function]]s and [[type]]s can be viewed as morphisms and objects in a [[category theory]] context

the [[empty]] [[set]] corresponds to the [[type]] `Void` in Haskell, which corresponds to $\bot$ in [[logic]] from a [[category theory]] perspective. when looking at propositions as types, [[function]]s are [[proof]]s. $\bot$ cannot be proven, similarly to how a [[function]] that takes `Void` as a parameter cannot be called

the singleton [[set]] corresponds to the [[type]] `()` (or `Unit`) in Haskell, which corresponds to $\top$ in [[logic]] from a [[category theory]] perspective. when looking at propositions as types, [[function]]s are [[proof]]s. $\top$ can be proven, similarly to how a [[function]] that takes `Unit` as a parameter can be called

a [[relation]] being reflexive is equivalent to the presence of identity morphisms in [[category theory]]

a [[category]] with exactly one object is a [[monoid]] (yes, that [[monoid]] from [[functional programming]])

the [[category]] of [[type]]s is equivalent to a strongly typed [[programming language]], as [[function]]s in such a language are only composable if their [[type]]s match

the terminal object of a [[category]] corresponds to the singleton [[set]] and the initial object of a [[category]] corresponds to the [[empty]] [[set]]

_co..._ refers to the same object in the opposite [[category]]. product & coproduct, monad & comonad, monoid & comonoid...
