# Moravec's Paradox

**definition** _Moravec's paradox_ is the counterintuitive observation that tasks trivial for humans are challenging for machines while tasks challenging for humans are trivial for machines

> **note** this is codswallop. tasks trivial or challenging for both humans and machines we unwittingly overlook because there is no [[cognitive dissonance]] to be resolved
