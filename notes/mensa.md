# Mensa

_the largest and oldest high-[[iq]] society_

[[mensa]] members are required to score in the **`98`**th percentile or higher on a standardized [[iq]] test, see [[standard score]]. this is approxiately to **`2`** or more [[standard deviation]]s above the [[mean]] [[iq]], which corresponds to an [[iq]] score of **`130`** or higher

[[mensa]] is meant to be a safe space and to provide a community for people with that kind of distinguishment. it is not meant to be an elitist organization

there are various reasons why someone might look into joining [[mensa]]:

- to be able to discuss the topic of [[intelligence]] as a whole
- to hang out with other people of the same caliber; to get a sense of belonging
- to prove to others that they are smart; for the prestige of it (see [[narcissistic personality disorder]])

there are two ways to join [[mensa]]:

- to take the [[mensa]] admissions test and score in the qualifying range
- to take an approved private [[iq]] test and score in in the qualifying range

> **note** the [[mensa]] admission test can often only be taken once. however, private [[iq]] tests can be taken any number of times and then only be submitted when the participant scores in the qualifying range. this can lead to a variety of issues:
>
> - taking one [[iq]] test multiple times can make someone become better at that one test, inflating their measured [[iq]]. this is entirely legal, whereas forging documents is illegal
> - there can be a conflict of interest where the person being paid to administer the test could interpret the test results "generously", especially if they know that result is close to the qualifying range
