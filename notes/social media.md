[[social media]] has devastating effects on teenagers, including:

- the need to be perfect
- feeling undesirable
- feeling like not having enough money
- feeling like not having enough friends

this can lead to [[anxiety]] disorders, [[depression]] and [[addiction]]. [[social media]] seems to take advantage of [[hijacking brain circuitry]] and [[subconscious manipulation]] to keep users hooked.

[[social media]] does more than selling its users' attention to advertisers:
