# Social Media

**tradeoffs**

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/lQ00Nii5gfE>

[[social media]] has devastating effects on teenagers, including making them feel like they need to be perfect, feel undesirable and unloved, feel like they do not have enough [[money]] or friends, and so on

this can lead to [[anxiety]] disorders, [[depression]] and [[addiction]]. [[social media]] seems to take advantage of [[brain circuitry hijack]]ing and [[subconscious manipulation]] to keep users hooked

[[social media]] does more than selling its users' attention to advertisers:

> [...] That's a little too simplistic.
>
> > It's the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behavior and perception that is the product.
>
> And that **is** the product &mdash; it's the only possible product. There's nothing else on the table that could possibly be called the product.

[[social media]] can be thought of as a dictatorship. no laws exist against [[social media]] having this much control because this is the first time in history that a single entity can affect a billion people so easily &mdash; and this includes governing bodies

more often than not, the upper echelons of society use [[social media]] as a bunch of shelves for thier trophies and empty statements, which has a negative effect on the self-esteem of the people who follow them. [[social media]] builds a society with no understanding of mistakes and no concept of forgiveness, in which people portray themselves as virtuous and perfect &mdash; <https://youtu.be/pBR3Sw9X93s>
