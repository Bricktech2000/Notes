# System over Goal

> **AKA** process-oriented, system-oriented, process over outcome

**see** [[habit]], [[aspiration]], [[goal]], [[system]]

most of our culture is outcome-oriented instead of process-oriented. focusing on outcomes can lead to feeling [[overwhelm]]ed and can prevent people from even starting the process itself (which could be wrongly rationalized as a lack of [[motivation]] or as [[laziness]]) &mdash; <https://youtu.be/\_ZVGXmafWqY?t=72>

because of [[system over goal]], tracking something is often better than trying to restrict it through willpower &mdash; <https://youtu.be/ewzC_ica4Fw>

**examples**

> **example** _seeing jobs in a [[system over goal]] way_
>
> focusing on “getting a job” is very abstract and outcome-oriented, see [[aspiration]]. instead, one should focus on “applying for 10 jobs a week”, which is a concrete [[habit]] that is easy to measure.
>
> even though that person wouldn’t be guaranteed to get a job that way (as they are not focusing on the outcome), they are still way more likely to reach the outcome (as the process is what often leads to the outcome).
>
> “getting a job” is completely out of one’s control, but “applying to 10 jobs a week” is entirely under one’s control. this can also increase the likelihood of that person getting a job.

> **proof** _systems are more effective than [[goal]]s_
>
> - successful and unsuccessful people share the same [[goal]]s, so therefore the goal cannot be what differentiates winners from loosers
> - achieving a [[goal]] only feels good for that moment in time, but then hinders longer-term progress as your [[motivation]] quickly fades afterwards
> - [[goal]]s can create an _either-or_ conflict: either you achieve the goal or you don't, even if you were making progress in the right direction
