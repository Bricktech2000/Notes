# System over Goal

**aka** _process-oriented, system-oriented, process over outcome_

**see** [[habit]], [[aspiration]], [[goal]], [[system]]

> "You do not rise to the level of your [[goal]]s. You fall to the level of your [[system]]s." &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=3017>

most of our culture is outcome-oriented instead of process-oriented. focusing on outcomes can lead to feeling [[overwhelm]]ed and can prevent people from even starting the process itself (which could be wrongly rationalized as a lack of [[motivation]] or as [[laziness]]) &mdash; <https://youtu.be/\_ZVGXmafWqY?t=72>

because of [[system over goal]], tracking something is often better than trying to restrict it through willpower &mdash; <https://youtu.be/ewzC_ica4Fw>. this is often referred to as _[[habit]] tracking_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=18342>. however, for the measure to stay relevant, it must never become the target, see [[goodharts law]]

**pros** _advantages of [[system over goal]]_

- successful and unsuccessful people share the same [[goal]]s, and therefore [[goal]]s cannot be what differentiates winners from losers
- achieving a [[goal]] only feels good for that moment in time, but then hinders longer-term progress as [[motivation]] quickly fades afterwards
- [[goal]]s can create an _either-or_ conflict: either you achieve the goal or you don't, even if you were making progress in the right direction

**examples**

> **example** _seeing jobs in a [[system over goal]] way_
>
> focusing on “getting a job” is very abstract and outcome-oriented, see [[aspiration]]. instead, one should focus on “applying for 10 jobs a week”, which is a concrete [[habit]] that is easy to measure.
>
> even though that person wouldn’t be guaranteed to get a job that way (as they are not focusing on the outcome), they are still way more likely to reach the outcome (as the process is what often leads to the outcome).
>
> “getting a job” is completely out of one’s control, but “applying to 10 jobs a week” is entirely under one’s control. this can also increase the likelihood of that person getting a job.
