# Total Order

**aka** _linear order_

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order>

**see** [[partial order]], [[preorder]]

**equiv** _set of paths of a "directed" [[list]]_

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _non-strict total order_ or simply _total order_ if it is a [[relation#antisymmetric relation]], a [[relation#reflexive relation]], [[relation#transitive relation]] and a [[relation#strongly connected relation]]

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _non-strict total order_ or simply _total order_ if it is a non-strict [[partial order]] and a [[relation#connected relation]]

> **example** _less than or equal to_ is a non-strict [[total order]] and therefore a non-strict [[partial order]] and therefore a non-strict [[preorder]] on the [[set]] of [[real]]s

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _strict total order_ if it is a [[relation#asymmetric relation]], a [[relation#irreflexive relation]], a [[relation#transitive relation]] and a [[relation#connected relation]]

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _strict total order_ if it is a strict [[partial order]] and a [[relation#connected relation]]

> **example** _less than_ is a strict [[total order]] and therefore a strict [[partial order]] and equivalently a strict [[preorder]] on the [[set]] of [[real]]s
