**see** [[zero-knowledge proof]]

**definition** A _mathematical proof_ is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. --- Wikipedia

[[boolean]] properties and identities can be useful in [[proof]]s

**definition** a _proof by counterexample_ is a form of [[proof]] for a statement with [[quantifier#universal quantifier]] that shows it is false by finding one counterexample

**definition** a _proof by contrapositive_ is a form of [[proof]] for a conditional statement that shows its contrapositive is true, deducing the original statement is also true

**definition** a _proof by contradiction_ is a form of [[proof]] that shows the [[boolean#negation]] negation of a statement implies a contradiction, deducing the statement must be true

**definition** a _proof by induction_ is a form of [[proof]] for a statement consisting of two stages:

1. a _base case_ proves the statement is true at an initial value $n_0$
2. an _induction case_ proves that if the statement holds for $n_k$ for an arbitrary $k$, then the statement holds for $n_{k + 1}$

**definition** a _proof by exhaustion_ (or _proof by cases_) is a form of [[proof]] for a statement consisting of two stages:

1. a [[proof]] that a [[set]] of cases is exhaustive (the statement is true if and only if at least one case is true)
2. a [[proof]] for each case
