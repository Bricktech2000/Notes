# Proof

**see** [[zero-knowledge proof]], [[math notation]]

**definition** A _mathematical proof_ is an inferential argument for a mathematical [[logic statement]], showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. --- Wikipedia

[[boolean algebra]] properties and identities can be useful in [[proof]]s

**definition** a _proof by counterexample_ is a form of [[proof]] for a [[logic statement]] with [[quantifier#universal quantifier]] that shows it is false by finding one counterexample

**definition** a _proof by contrapositive_ is a form of [[proof]] for a conditional [[logic statement]] that shows its [[boolean algebra]] contrapositive is true, deducing the original [[logic statement]] is also true

**definition** a _proof by contradiction_ is a form of [[proof]] that shows the [[boolean algebra]] negation of a [[logic statement]] implies a [[contradiction]], deducing the [[logic statement]] must be true

**definition** a _proof by induction_ is a form of [[proof]] for a [[logic statement]] consisting of two stages:

1.  a _base case_ proves the [[logic statement]] is true at an initial value **`n^0`**
2.  an _induction case_ proves that if the [[logic statement]] holds for **`n^k`** for an arbitrary **`k`**, then the [[logic statement]] holds for **`n^k:1`**

**definition** a _proof by exhaustion_ (or _proof by cases_) is a form of [[proof]] for a [[logic statement]] consisting of two stages:

1.  a [[proof]] that a [[set]] of cases is exhaustive (the [[logic statement]] is true if and only if at least one case in the [[set]] is true)
2.  a [[proof]] for each case
