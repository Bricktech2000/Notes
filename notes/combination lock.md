## Alternate Combination

**see** [[math notation]]

> **procedure** _finding the alternate combination to a Master Lock combination lock_
>
> let the original combination **`C`**. then, the alternate combination **`C_*`** was found to be **`C_* = C : (.7, 2, 0)`**
>
> > **note** to enter the alternate combination, first rotate the dial **counterclockwise**, then **clockwise**, then **counterclockwise**. this order is the inverse of that of the original combination

this method was developped by discovering the following [[fact]]s:

- bumps on code wheels are approximately **`3-2`** digits wide
- there is play in the system (roughly **`1`** digit wide). this means that the last code wheel will turn with the first code wheel for **`1`** digit before the friction disk keeps it from turning further
- padlock combination was found to be **`(15, 1, 7)`**. found alternate combination by setting the first digit to **`14`** and brute-forcing the two last digits. looking into the lock with a flashlight also helped align the code wheels more easily. alternate combination turned out to be **`(8, 3, 7)`**
