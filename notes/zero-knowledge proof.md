# Zero-Knowledge Proof

_a [[proof]] that an entity has [[knowledge]] of something that does not give away any additional information_

**see** [[proof]], [[cryptography]]

> **example** _colorblind verifier_
>
> a prover wants to show a verifier that they know the [[color]] of two balls without revealing either [[color]]. note that the verifier cannot see the [[color]] of either ball as they are colorblind
>
> 1. the verifier hides both balls behind their back and may or may not switch the balls around
> 2. the verifier reveals the balls and asks the prover to say whether the balls were switched or not
>
> the process above is repeated some number of times to reduce the [[probability]] of "[[luck]]y guesses" from an untrustworthy prover
>
> this [[algorithm]] proves with high [[probability]] that the prover knows the [[color]] of both balls without revealing either [[color]]
