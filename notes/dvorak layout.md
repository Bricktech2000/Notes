# Dvorak Layout

**see** [[qwerty layout]]

learning to type on the [[dvorak layout]] is an [[invest]]ment; it has a high initial [[switching cost]]. touch typing is [[muscle memory]], which can make the switch from other layouts especially frustrating

the [[dvorak layout]] makes typing slightly more comfortable than the [[qwerty layout]]. I almost never use the mouse and always have both hands on the keyboard, and so keyboard shortcuts are not an issue. I don't play [[video game]]s, so their control schemes are not an issue either. with that said, re-learning [[vim]] [[muscle memory]] was a bit of a bumpy ride

learning new keyboard layouts is similar to learning new spoken languages. you don't "forget" the [[qwerty layout]] if you keep practicing it from time to time. if you know what you're doing, switching between the two layouts becomes effortless
