# Specific Heat

see [[math-notation]]

**definition**

$Q = mc\Delta T$, where

- $Q$ is the potential [[energy]] stored in the form of heat, see [[electromagnetic-wave]]
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $c$ is the [[specific-heat]] of the body
- $\Delta T$ is the change in [[temperature]] of the body

**constants**

$c_{H_2O} = 4.184 \shortmid \text{J} \text- \text{g} ^\circ \text{C}$
