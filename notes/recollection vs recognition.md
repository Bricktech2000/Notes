> **example** _testing this theory_
>
> grab a magazine in your house you haven't looked at in a while. leaf through it and you will get the illusion of remembering virtually every advertisement and article. to prove that this is recognition and not recollection, before you turn to the next page, try to predict what's on it. there's no way you're going to be right. &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0>
