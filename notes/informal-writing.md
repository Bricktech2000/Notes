## common [[informal-writing]] practices

### capital letters

capital letters are not to be used at the beginning of sentences, unless automatically inserted. a sentence written entirely in capital letters indicates shouting

### question marks

_indicate the rise of the writer’s tone_

question marks are not required at the end of a question sentence. question marks can be added at the end of non-question sentences to indicate the rise of the writer’s tone

### full stops

_indicate seriousness_

full stops are not used at the end of sentences, unless they are meant to convey seriousness

### asterisk

_indicates emphasis or a correction_

when used around a word or a group of words, asterisks indicate emphasis. when used at the beginning of a message, an asterisk communicates a correction in the previous message

### sentences

longer sentences are often send as multiple shorter messages, and individual sentences are often communicated by sending multiple messages. multiple sentences can also be written one after the other with no [[punctuation]] if they can be orally read without a pause

### [[comma-splice]]s

_indicate two closely related sentences_

[[comma-splice]]s are valid in [[informal-writing]] for use between two closely related sentences. semi colons and [[dash]]es are almost never used. commas are not mandatory for [[comma-splice]]s, which can lead to an [[informal-writing]] construct known as a _space splice_

### quotation marks

quotation marks are almost never used in [[informal-writing]]. they shall not be used for emphasis
