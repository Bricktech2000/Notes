# Information Entropy

&mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>

**see** [[entropy]]

**definition** **`H = :PI`**, where

- **`P S E`** is the [[probability]] of the [[event]] **`E`** occuring in the [[sample space]] **`S`**
- **`I S E`** is the [[information content]] of the [[event]] **`E`** occuring in the [[sample space]] **`S`**
- **`H S`** is the [[information entropy]] of the [[sample space]] **`S`**

[[information entropy]] can be measured in [[shannon]]s and [[nat]]s, see [[information content]]

generally, the [[information entropy]] of a [[sample space]] **`S`** is the expected value of the [[information content]] of the [[event]]s in **`S`**
