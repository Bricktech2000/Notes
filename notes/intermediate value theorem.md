# Intermediate Value Theorem

**see** [[math notation]]

**theorem** let $f\ x$ be a continuous [[function]] on the interval $x \rightarrow (a \dashv x \dashv b)$ and let $u$ such that $f\ a \dashv u \dashv f\ b \lor f\ b \dashv u \dashv f\ a$ ($u$ is between $f\ a$ and $f\ b$). then, there is a $c$ in $c \rightarrow (a \dashv c \dashv b)$ such that $f\ c = u$ &mdash; Wikipedia
