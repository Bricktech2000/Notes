# Intermediate Value Theorem

**see** [[math notation]]

**theorem** let $f\ x$ be a [[function#continuous function]] on the interval $a \dashv \circ \dashv b$ and let $u$ such that $f\ a \dashv u \dashv f\ b \lor f\ b \dashv u \dashv f\ a$. then, there is a $c$ in $a \dashv \circ \dashv b$ such that $f\ c = u$ &mdash; Wikipedia
