# Problematic Statement

can cause ethical problems, as writing can be used as an instrument of manipulation (intentionally or unintentionally)

## examples

> science **says** that ... is the **only way** to ...

> vaccination is the **only way** to stop COVID

correct version:

> the government's public-health policy is ...

> Our cutting-edge editorial software was **designed** to replace an editor

it is **designed** to, but does it really work?

> I will do **whatever it takes** to beat the competition and **make sure we are first on the road**

but what about safety? the product will likely be rushed

you will not be able to do **whatever it takes**

> The cases of the **deadly** COVID-19 virus are soaring

**deadly** makes it seem like the death rate compared to the infection rate is high, but it isn't the case with COVID
