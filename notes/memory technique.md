# Memory Technique

**see** [[memory]], [[trick]]

[[memory technique]]s can be used as [[trick]]s to remember [[fact]]s more efficiently. [[memory technique]] are [[function#bijective function]]s between a [[fact]] to be memorized and a [[fact]] that is easier for the [[brain]] to remember

[[mnemonic]]s are an effective [[memory technique]]. bundling unrelated [[fact]]s into a single related construct can also help remember them --- me

[[memory]] athletes memorize through their semantic [[memory]]

> 1. turn each digit into a sound
> 2. turn sets of sounds into meaningful words
> 3. build a story from those words, joining them together (see [[memory]], [[mnemonic]])
> 4. add emotions and sensual information to the story to strengthen it (see [[memory]])
> 5. attach the story to a familiar place, known as the _memory palace_ (see [[memory]])

> Keraunophobia can be broken down into to parts
>
> - _phobia_ --- this part is known to mean _fear_
> - _kerauno_ --- this part can be memorized using the similar-sound cue technique
>   1. _kerauno_ sounds similar to _Karen_ --- similar-sound
>   2. remember the sentence _Karen is scared of lightning and thunder_ --- cue
>
> Keraunophobia is the fear of lightning and thunder... because Karen is scared of lightning and thunder. this is a far superior to other methods to remember the meaning of a word
