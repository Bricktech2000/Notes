# Esoteric Programming Language Idea

**see** [[programming language]]

inspired by [[conventional math notation]], where [[operator]]s like to change what they return based on what surrounds them

## initiators

- whether a comment is present in a [[function]]
- number of [[character]]s in a line

## operations

- `+` but sometimes `-`
- `if` and `while`
- `&&` or `true`
- `||` or `2`
- `=` or `==`
