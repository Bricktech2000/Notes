# Perfectionism VS High Standards

#think <https://youtu.be/cI2rMEd6GW4?t=2756>

a lot of people seem to misinterpret high standards as perfectionism

I believe I have higher-than-average standards, which can lead many to believe I am a perfectionist

**definition** _perfectionism_ is refusing to accept any standard short of perfection

**definition** _high standards_ are the quality of being outstanding or extremely good
