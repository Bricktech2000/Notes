# Perfectionism VS High Standards

a lot of people seem to misinterpret high standards as perfectionism

I believe I have higher standards than most people, which can lead many to believe I am a perfectionist

**definition** _perfectionism_ is refusing to accept any standard short of perfection

**definition** _high standards_ are the quality of being outstanding or extremely good
