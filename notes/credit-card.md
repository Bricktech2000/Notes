# Credit Card

## advantages of credit cards over debit cards

- [[credit-card]]s allow for small loans without having to go to the [[bank]]
- debit cards are essentially non-revolving credit cards, which means that their interchange fees could end up being higher as those fees are their only source of revenue
- (?) [[credit-card]]s allow for higher security as the payment to merchants is delayed by a few days

## other advantages of credit cards

- widespread ownership of [[credit-card]]s allow for e-commerce (aka online shopping)
- more efficient than cash, checks, in-store credit
- better fraud protection (often done through the use of AI)
- they allow consumers to get a statement of every transaction
- 73% of consumers think that roll-over "makes it easier" (this seems to me like a flawed way to manage [[money]])

## other notes

- [[credit-card]] companies make 65% to 80% of their profits through revolving debt (through late fees)
