## Properties

_[[atom]]ic properties_

**see** [[orbital]], [[atom]]

**see** [[electronegativity]]

### Atomic Radius

_the radius of the [[atom]]_

larger on the left, bottom of the periodic table

### Ionization Energy

_the amount of [[energy]] required to remove one [[electron]] from a neutral [[atom]] in the gas [[phase]]_

larger on the top, right of the periodic table

### Electron Affinity

_the amount of [[energy]] required or released to add one [[electron]] to a neutral [[atom]] in the gas [[phase]]_

not as regular as other [[atom]]ic properties

larger on the top, right of the periodic table

### Atomic Number

the number of [[proton]]s in the nucleus of an [[atom]]

### Atomic Mass

includes [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s

> **note** more often than not, the [[mass]] of [[electron]]s is negligible
