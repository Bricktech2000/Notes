## atomic properties

_electronegativity_ is the tendency of an [[atom]] in a [[bond]] to pull [[electron]]s towards itself. larger on top, right of the periodic table

_atomic radius_ is the radius of the [[atom]]. larger on the left, bottom of the periodic table

_ionization energy_ is the amount of [[energy]] required to remove one [[electron]] from a neutral [[atom]] in the gas [[phase]]. larger on the top, right of the periodic table

_electron affinity_ is the amount of [[energy]] required or released to add one [[electron]] to a neutral [[atom]] in the gas [[phase]]. not as regular as other [[atom]]ic properties larger on the top, right of the periodic table

_atomic number_ is the number of [[proton]]s in the nucleus of an [[atom]]

_atomic mass_ is the mass of an [[atom]], including [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s. though often, the [[mass]] of [[electron]]s is negligible
