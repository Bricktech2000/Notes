# Debate

[[debate]]s can benefit from the [[nested conversation structure]]

## Effectiveness

there exists a strong correlation between [[debate#effectiveness]] and debater mindset; approaching a [[debate]] with the shared desire of [[knowledge]], progress and growth is required for a [[debate]] to be effective &mdash; me

I'll be blunt: some arguments are plain out dumb and not worth responding to. it's important to recognize such arguments, because responding to them can quickly spiral down into a fight over unsubstantial nonsense. similarly, some people are not worth the [[time]] and [[energy]] debating with because they approach [[debate]]s as a means of convincing others of their own beliefs rather than as an opportunity to develop them and refine them. participating in ineffective [[debate]]s is counterproductive

> **examples** _characteristics of effective [[debate]]s_
>
> - open-mindedness
> - willingness to change one's own opinion
> - separation of ideas from people
> - desire to refine one's own perspective
> - desire to learn from others
> - listening to understand; see [[response]]

> **examples** _characteristics of ineffective [[debate]]s_
>
> - shared stubbornness or defensiveness
> - use of personal attacks and dismissive language
> - overwhelming desire to be right
> - merging of ideas with [[identity]]
> - appeal to authority or status
> - listening to reply; see [[reaction]]

> **example** phrases such as _I am a democrat_ and _I am a feminist_ are dangerous because they signal a merging of ideas with [[identity]], which often leads to ineffective [[debate]]s

> **example** _going in trying to prove others wrong and coming out with balanced opinions_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY>

> **note** a while ago, after a [[debate]], a few friends told me I had been very "**neutral**"; at the time I rolled with it. some time ago, when watching a [[debate]] unfold, I felt **disinterested**; it felt a bit pointless. recently, during a [[debate]], an acquaintance told me I was being very **patient**; but I wasn't at all trying to be patient. that's when it started to click. maybe I'm being affected by [[hindsight bias]], but [[debate#effectiveness]] sounds somewhat obvious in retrospect. regardless, I believe it is a powerful idea that can now benefit from [[conceptual note-taking]] [[frequency illusion]]
