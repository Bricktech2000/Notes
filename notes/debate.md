# Debate

[[debate]]s can benefit from the [[nested conversation structure]]

## Effectiveness

there exists a strong correlation between [[debate#effectiveness]] and debater mindset; approaching a [[debate]] with the shared desire of [[knowledge]], progress and growth is required for a [[debate]] to be effective &mdash; me

I'll be blunt: some arguments are plain out dumb and not worth responding to. it's important to recognize such arguments, because responding to them can quickly spiral down into a fight over unsubstantial nonsense. similarly, some people are not worth the [[time]] and [[energy]] to debate with because they approach [[debate]]s as a means to convince others of their own beliefs rather than as an opportunity to learn and grow. participating in ineffective [[debate]]s is counterproductive

> **examples** _characteristics of effective [[debate]]s_

> - open-mindedness
> - willingness to change one's own opinion
> - separation of ideas from people
> - desire to refine one's own perspective
> - desire to learn from others

> **examples** _characteristics of ineffective [[debate]]s_
>
> - shared stubbornness or defensiveness
> - use of personal attacks and dismissive language
> - overwhelming desire to be right
> - merging of ideas with [[identity]]
> - reliance on authority or status

> **note** a while ago, after a [[debate]], a few friends told me I had been very "**neutral**"; at the time I rolled with it. some time ago, when watching a [[debate]] unfold, I felt **disinterested** in participating; somehow it felt pointless. recently, during a [[debate]], an acquaintance told me I was being very **patient**; however, I wasn't at all trying to be patient. that's where it started to click. maybe I'm being affected by [[hindsight bias]], but [[debate#effectiveness]] sounds somewhat obvious in retrospect. regardless, I believe it is a powerful idea that can now benefit from [[conceptual note-taking]] [[frequency illusion]]
