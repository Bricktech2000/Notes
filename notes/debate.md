# Debate

**see** [[nonverbal#connotation]]

[[debate]]s can benefit from the [[nested conversation structure]]

when engaging in debates it's crucial to reason on a "meta" level to avoid getting caught up in thorny bushes. if you know you won't be changing your opinions today then it's unlikely they'll be changing theirs, so take a second for a reality check. debates are not contests

statements like _I am a democrat_ and _I am a feminist_ are dangerous because they suggest a merging of ideas with [[identity]]
