I'll be blunt: some arguments are plain out dumb and not worth responding to. it's important to recognize such arguments, because responding to them can quickly spiral down into a fight over unsubstantial nonsense. similarly, some people are not worth the [[time]] and [[energy]] to debate with because they approach [[debate]]s as a means to convince others of their own beliefs rather than as an opportunity to learn and grow
