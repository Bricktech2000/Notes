# Proxy

**see** [[statistics]], [[goodhart's law]], [[equality]]

**definition** a _proxy_ is a variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable --- Wikipedia

[[proxy]]es have either a positive or a negative correlation with the variable they are proxies for

> **examples**
>
> - degrees are a [[proxy]] for knowledge. also see mass [[education]] issues
> - resumes are a [[proxy]] for professional experience and competence
> - ownership of branded goods is a [[proxy]] for [[wealth]] and status
> - per-capita [[gross domestic product]] is a [[proxy]] for standard of living --- Wikipedia

## Pursuit

recognizing and identifying [[proxy]]es is important, for often they are mistaken for the variables they are proxies for. this can lead to what I like to call "proxy pursuits", where people work on chasing or fixing what they don't realize are deceptively poor proxies. these proxies, in some sense, are _counterfeits_ --- Erik Goodwyn --- <https://youtu.be/FxbBgqKwGW4?t=10m56s>

one class of [[proxy#pursuit]]s that's easy to recognize in the wild is people (metaphorically) treating the symptoms because they don't see the disease

[[proxy#pursuit]]s are susceptible to [[goodhart's law]]

> **examples**
>
> - going to the gym to build muscle (a [[proxy]] for fitness) instead of actually becoming fit
> - taking easy classes to get a higher GPA (a [[proxy]] for knowledge) instead of actually learning more
> - escaping from negative emotions ([[proxy]]es for deeper issues) instead actually working to fix the underlying issues
>   > **note** this can take many forms: taking on busywork, using [[social media]], [[projection]]...
> - watching a movie to avoid boredom (a [[proxy]] for stagnation) instead of actually exploring interesting new things

> **examples**
>
> - _be authentic_, except when someone is, they get dismissed, silenced, made fun of, criticized --- <https://youtu.be/3DQrJ8Gsw9o?t=14m58s>
> - _don't be scared/timid_, except actually yes do be scared/timid there's a good reason to be
> - _don't be a conformist_ --- _Petit cours d'autodÃ©fense intellectuelle_, 1.2.2, except actually yes do be because rejection can be costly
> - _just trust the hold_, except when I did I took a sketchy fall and almost hurt myself, so don't
> - _never judge a book by its cover_, except actually there's a reason we do it and it's that it works well enough most of the time
