# Proxy

**aka** _proxy variable_

**see** [[statistics]], [[goodhart's law]], [[equality]]

**definition** a _proxy_ is a variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable &mdash; Wikipedia

[[proxy]]es must have either a positive or a negative correlation with the variable they are proxies for

> **examples**
>
> - degrees are a [[proxy]] for knowledge. also see mass [[education]] issues
> - resumes are a [[proxy]] for professional experience and competence
> - ownership of branded goods is a [[proxy]] for [[wealth]] and status
> - per-capita [[gross domestic product]] is a [[proxy]] for standard of living &mdash; Wikipedia

recognizing and identifying [[proxy]]es is crucial, for they are often mistaken for the variables they are proxies for. one consequence of this behavior is an effect I like to call "fixing the proxy", which is susceptible to [[goodhart's law]]

> **examples**
>
> - going to the gym to build muscle (a [[proxy]] for fitness) instead of actually becoming fit
> - taking easy classes to get a higher GPA (a [[proxy]] for knowledge) instead of actually learning more
> - escaping from emotions (a [[proxy]] for well-being) instead of actually fixing underlying issues

_in life [...] we devalue the thing that leads to the result and instead we value the result as a [[proxy]] to the thing_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/kPZwR3v_UyI?t=2h1m43s>
