# Proxy

**see** [[statistics]], [[goodhart's law]], [[equality]]

**definition** a _proxy_ is a variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable --- Wikipedia

[[proxy]]es have either a positive or a negative correlation with the variable they are proxies for

> **examples**
>
> - degrees are a [[proxy]] for knowledge. also see mass [[education]] issues
> - resumes are a [[proxy]] for professional experience and competence
> - ownership of branded goods is a [[proxy]] for [[wealth]] and status
> - per-capita [[gross domestic product]] is a [[proxy]] for standard of living --- Wikipedia

# Pursuit

recognizing and identifying [[proxy]]es is important, for they are often mistaken for the variables they are proxies for. this can lead to what I like to call "proxy pursuits", where people work on chasing or fixing what they don't realize are deceptively poor proxies

one class of [[proxy#pursuit]]s that's easy to recognize in the wild is people (metaphorically) treating the symptoms because they don't see the disease

[[proxy#pursuit]]s are susceptible to [[goodhart's law]]

> **examples**
>
> - going to the gym to build muscle (a [[proxy]] for fitness) instead of actually becoming fit
> - taking easy classes to get a higher GPA (a [[proxy]] for knowledge) instead of actually learning more
> - escaping from negative emotions ([[proxy]]es for deeper issues) instead actually working to fix the underlying issues
>   > **note** this can take many forms: taking on busywork, scrolling on [[social media]], [[projection]]...
> - watching a movie to avoid boredom (a [[proxy]] for stagnation) instead of actually exploring interesting new things

_in life [...] we devalue the thing that leads to the result and instead we value the result as a [[proxy]] to the thing_ --- <https://youtu.be/kPZwR3v_UyI?t=2h1m43s>
