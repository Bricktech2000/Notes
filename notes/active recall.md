# Active Recall

_actively [[learning]] by retrieving information from your brain_

**see** [[spaced repetition]], [[interleaving]]

**aka** _active retrieval_, _practice-testing_, _quizzing yourself_

[[active recall]] sources its effectiveness from the reorganisation of information that occurs when trying to remember it. it forces **active [[learning]]** and makes us practice answering questions, which is often the way we are tested. it also provides us with **timely feedback** on our performance

> **examples** _active recall strategies_
>
> - noting down questions instead of summaries and trying to answer them to learn (similar to the _Cornell method_)
> - using flashcards for learning [[fact]]s instead of using mnemonics or other [[memory#technique]]s

_recollection_ (retrieving information from memory) is often confused with _recognition_ (identifying information one has seen before). [[active recall]] is about recollection, not recognition --- <https://youtu.be/RJKNtXgo39o?t=1081>

> **proof** _recognition is not recollection_ grab a magazine in your house you haven't looked at in a while. leaf through it and you will get the illusion of remembering virtually every advertisement and article. to show that this is _recognition_ and not _recollection_, before you turn to the next page, try to predict what's on it: there's no way you're going to be right --- <https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=2086>
