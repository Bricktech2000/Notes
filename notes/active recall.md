# Active Recall

_actively [[learning]] by retrieving information from your brain_

**see** [[spaced repetition]], [[interleaving]]

**aka** _active retrieval, practice-testing, quizzing yourself_

[[active recall]] sources its effectiveness from the reorganisation of information that occurs when trying to remember it. it forces **active [[learning]]** and makes us practice answering questions, which is often the way we are tested. it also provides us with **timely feedback** on our performance

> **examples** _active recall strategies_
>
> - noting down questions instead of summaries and trying to answer them to learn (similar to the _Cornell method_)
> - using flashcards for learning [[fact]]s instead of using [[mnemonic]]s or other [[memory technique]]s

_recollection_ (retrieving information from memory) is often confused with _recognition_ (identifying information one has seen before). [[active recall]] is about recollection, not recognition &mdash; <https://youtu.be/RJKNtXgo39o?t=1081>

> **proof** _recollection != recollection_ grab a magazine in your house you haven't looked at in a while. leaf through it and you will get the illusion of remembering virtually every advertisement and article. to prove that this is _recognition_ and not _recollection_, before you turn to the next page, try to predict what's on it. there's no way you're going to be right &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=2086>

> **note** _personal theory on active recall_
>
> this theory represents the idea that [[active recall]] provides the **feedback** necessary for our subconscious to learn to store the right information. since our subconscious is trying to figure out whether we have successfully learned what we set out to learn, it must have access to **feedback** that is a **[[function]] of its inputs**, see [[learning]]. if it does not have access to said feedback, it assumes we have already learned enough and does not unnecessarily waste [[energy]] trying to learn further. following this theory, [[spaced repetition]] can be thought as **repeatedly** teaching our subconscious to store the right information, and [[sleep]] can be thought of as the **timely active [[learning]]** phase of our subconscious, where it consolidates memories as it erases what turns out to have low value

> our subconscious battling our [[self-control]] over [[energy]] efficiency can also be observed in certain types of [[procrastination]]
