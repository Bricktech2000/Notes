# Active Recall

_actively [[learning]] by retrieving information from your brain_

**see** [[spaced repetition]], [[interleaving]]

> **AKA** active retrieval, practice-testing, quizzing yourself

[[active recall]] sources its effectiveness from the reorganisation of information that occurs when trying to remember it. it forces **active [[learning]]** and makes us practice answering questions, which is often the way we are tested. it also provides us with **timely feedback** on our performance

> **examples** _active recall strategies_
>
> - noting down questions instead of summaries and trying to answer them to learn (similar to the _Cornell method_)
> - using flashcards for learning [[fact]]s instead of using [[mnemonic]]s or other [[memory technique]]s

> **note** _personal theory on active recall_
>
> this theory represents the idea that [[active recall]] provides the **feedback** necessary for our subconscious to learn to store the right information. since our subconscious is trying to figure out whether we have successfully learned what we set out to learn, it must have access to **feedback** that is a **[[function]] of its inputs**, see [[learning]]. if it does not have access to said feedback, it assumes we have already learned enough and does not unnecessarily waste [[energy]] trying to learn further. following this theory, [[spaced repetition]] can be thought as **repeatedly** teaching our subconscious to store the right information, and [[sleep]] can be thought of as the **timely active learning** phase of our subconscious, where it consolidates memories as it erases what turns out to have low value
>
> our subconscious batteling our willpower over [[energy]] efficiency can also be observed in certain types of [[procrastination]]
