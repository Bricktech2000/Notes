# Ideal Gas

see [[stoichiometry]], [[math-notation]]

> An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions. &mdash; Wikipedia

## Ideal Gas Law

$PV = nRT$, where

$P$ is the [[pressure]] of the gas

$V$ is the [[volume]] of the gas

$n$ is the [[amount-of]] gas present

$R$ is the ideal gas constant

$T$ is the absolute [[temperature]] of the gas

## Ideal Gas Constant

$R = 8.31451 J \text- mol\ K = 8.31451 L\ kPa \text- mol\ K = 0.08314 L\ bar \text- mol\ K$

## Dalton's Law

> Dalton's law states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. &mdash; Wikipedia

$P = P_0 : \dots P_n \land \N n$, where

$P$ is the total pressure exerted

$P_i$ is the partial pressure of each gas
