# Outer Product

_APL-style Outer Product_

&mdash; <https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Outer_Product>

a $\cdot$ placed over an [[operator]] turns it into an [[outer product]], where that [[operator]] is applied to every [[ordered pair]] of elements from the objects. the rank of the [[outer product]] of two objects is the sum of the ranks of the two objects. the shape of the [[outer product]] of two objects is the concatenation of the shapes of the two objects. see [[rank polymorphism]]

> **note** when applying an [[outer product]] to an object with non-zero rank and a [[scalar]], the [[outer product]] "dot" can be omitted
>
> > **example** $5 (1, 2, 3) = 5 \mid (1, 2, 3) = 5\ \dot\mid\ (1, 2, 3) = (5, 10, 15)$
