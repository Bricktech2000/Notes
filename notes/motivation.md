# Motivation

> **resource** some talk the talk; some walk the walk. "venting your [[goal]]s kills [[motivation]]", by Dr. K &mdash; <https://youtu.be/uDDeves6Crs>

_[[motivation]] is not a prerequisite for action_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/hJZ5v7dpKKM?t=323>. telling ourselves _I don't feel motivated enough to do it_ is blaming our circumstances instead of gaining control over our actions, which goes against [[stoicism]]
