believing in the existence of a god seems to be a catch-all way for people to explain what they can't understand

more generally, this could be phrased as:

> belief in a higher power brings comfort to people by providing meaning to concepts they are lacking the intelligence to rationally give meaning to &mdash; me

examples include:

- rationalizing the creation of the universe by a higher power (instead of trying to actually explain it)
- praying to a higher power for help (instead of trying to solve their problems themselves)
- believing in paradise to provide comfort in the face of death (instead of accepting they don't know what happens after death)

methods people use to cope with the unknown include:

- believing a higher power understands the unknown (such a belief could be reinforced by confirmation [[bias]])
- spending the time to try to understand the unknown
- accepting they cannot understand the unknown
