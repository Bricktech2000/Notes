# Religion

believing in the existence of a god seems to be a catch-all way for people to explain what they can't understand

more generally, this could be phrased as:

> belief in a higher power brings comfort by providing meaning to [[concept]]s people lack the [[intelligence]] or [[knowledge]] to rationally explain &mdash; me

> **examples** _a higher power bringing comfort_
>
> - rationalizing the creation of the universe through a higher power (instead of hypothesizing a natural process)
> - praying to a higher power for help (instead of solving problems ourselves, a principle of [[stoicism]])
> - believing in paradise to provide comfort in the face of death (instead of making peace with the unknown)

> **examples** _other methods people use to cope with the unknown_
>
> - believing that a higher power understands the unknown (such a belief could be reinforced by [[confirmation bias]])
> - spending the [[time]] and [[energy]] to try and understand the unknown
> - accepting that understanding the unknown is not always possible
