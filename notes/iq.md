# IQ

_an attempt to quantify [[intelligence]]_

studies have estimated that [[iq]] is weakly correlated with genetics in children (**`2-10 -| * -| 4-10`** heritability) with environmental factors playing a significant role, and strongly correlated with genetics in late teens and adults (**`7-10 -| * -| 8-10`** heritability) &mdash; La Douance p. 100 and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ>

**properties** _[[iq]] scores_

- have a [[mean]], [[median]] and [[mode]] of **`100`**
- have a [[standard deviation]] of **`15`**
- have a [[probability distribution#skew]] of **`0`**
- form a [[probability distribution#normal distribution]]
