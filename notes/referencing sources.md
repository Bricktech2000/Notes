# Referencing Sources

see [[common knowledge]]

## citing authors

> _Citing_ is a paraphrase of words or thought by some person. Quotation marks are not present and the source has to be cited.

> Paraphrase (Author 52).

## quoting authors

_Quoting_ and _Citing_ are two ways of using sources. see [[plagiarism]]

> _Quoting_ is basically repeating something someone has said or written verbatim. Quotation marks are required and the source has to be cited.

> Author says "Quote" (Author 24), but ...

- nested quotes are replaced by single quotes
- when trying to emphasize the information, the first of the two following is preferred:
  > "The winter is cold" (John Doe, 2000)
  > John Doe (2000) said "The winter is cold"
- modified words inside a quote must be enclosed by square brackets `[ ]`
- integrate quotes into sentences, don't have a quote be a sentence itself

### referencing 4 or more authors

usually, if an article has 1, 2 or 3 authors, list them all. otherwise, list the first one and "et al.", which is Latin for "and others"

### referencing websites

the author is an abbreviation of the website name, but that still allows it to be identified in the bibliography. examples:

> (Addiction, 2012)
> (Internet Addiction, 2012)
> (New Treatments, 2012)
