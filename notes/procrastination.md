# Procrastination

_it isn’t a problem; it’s a solution_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=9715>

[[procrastination]] is an umbrella term, an emergent phenomenon that’s based on all kinds of different processes &mdash; <https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=2653>

> **example** _procrastination for studying before a test_
>
> our [[brain]] has a circuit that tries to figure out how to be efficient. however, perfection is almost never the most [[energy]]-efficient solution to a problem.
>
> > why would I spend 30 hours over a full month studying to get an A where I could spend 5 hours studying the night before to get a B

## Consequences

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/o3YtcwPI5fw>

### tangible consequences

_a failed grade, an upset friend_

tangible consequences can lead to stress an panic, creating the [[motivation]] needed to complete a task.

### intangible consequences

_not exercising, not keeping in touch with someone_

intangible consequences do not have any tangible repercussions, but are just as damaging as tangible consequences.
