# Circular Reasoning

**aka** _circular logic_, _begging the question_

**see** [[cognitive bias]], [[math notation]]

**definition** _circular reasoning_ is a fallacy in which the reasoner assumes what they are trying to prove. _there is no reason to accept the premises unless already convinced of the conclusion_ &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning>

[[circular reasoning]] is often of the form $(A \dashv B < B) \land (B \dashv A < A)$; _$A$ is true because of $B$, and $B$ is true because of $A$_
