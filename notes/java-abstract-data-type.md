# Java Abstract Data Type

## examples

- [[stack]]s
- [[queue]]s
- lists

abstract data [[type]]s can be implemented through [[interface]]s

> **definition**: in [[java]], an _interface_ is an abstract [[type]] that is used to specify what behavior a [[class]] should implement. interfaces may only contain abstract method signatures and constant declarations.
