# Lightness

_perceived [[luminance]]_

**see** [[color science]], [[luminance]], [[cielab]], [[gamma correction]], [[math notation]], [[luma]]

**notation** **`J`** (used in CIECAM02), **`L^\*`** (used in [[cielab]] and CIELUV)

**definition** in [[color science]], _lightness_ is a linear prediction of the perceived brightness of a color by the human eye &mdash; Wikipedia

when green [[luminance]] equals red [[luminance]] equals blue [[luminance]], green [[lightness]] is greater than red [[lightness]] is greater than blue [[lightness]]

cameras automatically set their exposure to achieve an average [[cie 1931#xyz]] [[luminance]] of **`Y = 0 184-1000`** in the image, which is a [[lightness]] (perceived [[luminance]]) of **`50-100`** and a [[cielab]] [[lightness]] of **`50-100`**. this is why _18% gray cards_ can be used to calibrate exposure &mdash; <https://youtu.be/a4kU3ZUX44Y> and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_gray>
