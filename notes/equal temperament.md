# Equal Temperament

**`1-1`**, **`2-1`** and **`3-2`** are the most important [[musical interval]]s. we would like to build scale consisting of a mix of fifths and octaves, and so we add notes until a combination of fifts and octaves ends up at the starting note again. however, the fact is, this will never happen; that is, there exists no solution to **`[2-1]m[3-2]n /\ ZZ {m /\ n}`** but **`{m /\ n} = 0`**

fortunately, it turns out that **`[2-1]12 ~ -[3-2]7`**; that is, by splitting up the octave in **`12`** equal [[musical interval]]s, we get perfect octaves and very good approximations to perfect fifths, with **`3-2 ~ 2[7-12]`**. the idea behind [[equal temperament]] is that all simple [[musical interval]]s (apart from octaves) are imperfect but close enough to sound good to the human ear

**properties**

all [[musical interval]]s between consecutive notes are equal; this allows for perfect transposition

while [[equal temperament]] fifths are close to perfect fifths, [[equal temperament]] thirds are not so close to perfect thirds

> **proof** **`2[4-12] -- 5-4 ~ 1 0079-10000`** but **`3-2 -- 2[7-12] ~ 1 0011-10000`**
