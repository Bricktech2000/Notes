_the Why-How-What organization system_

[[why-how-what]] is a universal organization system taylored to the way I work. in a [[tree]] directory structure, items are sorted in the `Why -> How -> What` pattern, where _Why, How, What_ represent directory names and `->` represent [[tree]] parent-to-child relationships. in a tag-based system, every item is given a _Why_ and most items are given a _How_. in a single-level [[list]]-like structure (such as the one below), items are duplicated in both a _Why_ [[list]] and a _How_ [[list]]. in a [[set]]-like structure where there exist no structure between items, item names are preceeded by an identifier constructed from the first letter of every tag it would be given in a tag-based system.

## Why

for humans to function, they must take care of their bodies (eating, showering...) &mdash; Body. in order to do stuff, one needs to know the right people and have the right resources &mdash; Network and Finance. time is as limited resource, and it must be utilized as efficiently as possible &mdash; Optimize. information is not permanent (our brains forget, hard drives fail...) and it often must be made permanent &mdash; Reproduce. to be able to form new ideas, one needs to learn and understand [[concept]]s in different [[fields]] and should have access to information most people do not have access to &mdash; Learning and Intel

many items are only weakly related to one of the above categories, but represent the idea that a standard must be maintained &mdash; Standard. ~~some items are not related to any of the above categories, but are still important &mdash; Misc~~. some items are unimportant and should probably be removed (wasting time, storing a file with low value, physical clutter) &mdash; Zilch
