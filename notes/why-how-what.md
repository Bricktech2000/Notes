_the Why-How-What organization system_

[[why-how-what]] is a universal organization system taylored to the way I work. in a [[tree]] directory structure, items are sorted in the `Why -> How -> What` pattern, where _Why, How, What_ represent directory names and `->` represent [[tree]] parent-to-child relationships. in a tag-based system, every item is given a _Why_ and most items are given a _How_. in a single-level [[list]]-like structure (such as the one below), items are duplicated in both a _Why_ [[list]] and a _How_ [[lit]]. in a [[set]]-like structure where there exist no structure between items, item names are preceeded by an identifier constructed from the first letter of every tag it would be given in a tag-based system.

current _why_ categories include:

- body (brown)
- intel (purple)
- zlich (dark gray)
- learn (orange)
- finance (green)
- network (blue)
- standard (pink)
- organize (yellow)
- eptimize (orange)
- reproduce (red)

current _how_ categories include:

- hack (dark gray)
- write (dark gray)
- think (dark gray)
- other (dark gray)
- social (dark gray)
- design (dark gray)
- program (dark gray)
- research (dark gray)
