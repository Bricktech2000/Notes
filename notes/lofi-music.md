# LoFi Music

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/OeFujF6LdAM>

**properties**

- a Jazzy instrumental
- a drum-beat combo of base and snare called _boom bap_ played intentionally off-kilter
- intentional environmental noise
- plays at around $70 \dots 90$ BPM
- generally falls in the rage of [[frequency]]es $200 \text{Hz} \dots 10000 \text{Hz}$

**applications**

because of its properties, [[lofi-music]] can help its listeners [[focus]] better

- it can block out distracting environmental noises when absolute silence is not a possibility
- it can act as a stimulant; it is refreshing and fresh, but slow and repetitive enough to become subconsciously predictable
- the dampened frequency range and environmental noise push it to the background and draws attention away from the music itself
- listening to it regularly could result in long-term [[focus]] improvements from [[environmental-dependency-of-learning]] &mdash; me
