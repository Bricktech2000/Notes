# Improved Recipe Structure

&mdash; initial idea by Kiera

> **procedure** _principles of [[improved recipe structure]]_
>
> - synchronous steps have different indentation levels whereas asynchronous steps have identical indentation levels
> - "subrecipes" are indented and placed above their parent step so the recipe can still be read top to bottom
> - [[ingredient]] quantities are included directly in the step in which they are used

> **example** _Cajun Shrimp and Sausage Rice_
>
> - &nbsp;
>   - In a large stockpot over medium heat, heat <u>**1 tbsp olive oil**</u> until shimmering. Cook <u>**8 oz sweet Italian sausage links**</u> until browned and cooked through. Transfer them to a plate and tent with aluminum foil.
>     - Chop <u>**1 cup onion**</u>, <u>**1/2 cup bell pepper**</u> and <u>**1/2 cup celery**</u>.
>   - In a large stockpot over medium heat, add the onion, pepper and celery and cook for 5 minutes, stirring and scraping up any brown bits. Add <u>**2 cups white rice**</u> and cook until the rice starts to appear opaque, another 3 to 5 minutes.
>     Stir in <u>**2 tbsp Cajun spice blend**</u> and then add <u>**4 cups chicken stock**</u>, scraping up any brown bits. Bring the mixture to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
>     - Thaw, peel and devein <u>**8 oz medium shrimp**</u>.
>   - In a pan, heat <u>**1 tsp olive oil**</u> until shimmering. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink, about 5 minutes.
> - Slice the sausages. Incorporate the shrimp, sausages and rice into the pot. Cover and cook until the rice is tender and the shrimp are pink, another 10 to 15 minutes.

**pros**

- no need to refer to [[ingredient]]s list when cooking as quantities are included in the step in which they are used
- improved structure allows for easy visualization of the recipe at a glance
- someone who does not understand the structure can still make the recipe by reading it from top to bottom
- easy to understand the purpose of an [[ingredient]]

**cons**

- buying [[ingredient]]s can be more [[time]] consuming for people using [[ingredient]] lists as shopping lists
