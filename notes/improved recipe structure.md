# Improved Recipe Structure

&mdash; initial idea by Kiera

> **procedure** _principles of [[improved recipe structure]]_
>
> - synchronous steps are denoted with indented blocks and asynchronous steps with unordered lists
> - substeps (subrecipes) are indented and placed above their parent step
> - ingredient quantities are included directly in the step in which they are used

> **example** see [[cajun shrimp and sausage rice]]

**pros**

- no need to refer to ingredients list when cooking as quantities are included in the step in which they are used
- improved structure allows for easy visualization of the recipe at a glance
- someone who does not understand the structure can still make the recipe by reading it from top to bottom
- easy to understand the purpose of an ingredient

**cons**

- buying ingredients can be more [[time]] consuming if the cook uses the ingredients list as their shopping list
