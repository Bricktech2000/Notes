# Color Science

[[color science]] is all about capturing and reproducing [[color]]s so they look accurate to the human eye

our eyes see [[color]] in a way that can be described as a [[euclidean vector]] of three [[real]]s in the [[lms]] [[color space]]. this means that many colors we percieve to be the same have different [[spectral power distribution]]s. two colors are called _metamers_ if they are perceived to be the same color, which is an effect called _metamerism_
