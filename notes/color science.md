# Color Science

[[color science]] is all about capturing and reproducing [[color]]s so they look accurate to the human eye

our eyes see [[color]] in a way that can be described as a [[vector in rn]] of 3 numbers in the [[lms]] [[color space]]. this means that many colors we percieve to be the same have different [[spectral power distribution]]s. two colors are called _metamers_ if they are perceived to be the same color, which is an effect called _metamerism_

#todo our eyes (brains) have auto white balance whereas cameras don't so we need to set the white balance manually
