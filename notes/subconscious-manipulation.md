# Subconscious Manipulation

A lot of "things" in this world seem to directly target our subconscious mind in order to trick us into making decisions we wouldn't have made otherwise.

## examples

- short-term [[credit-card]] rewards trick a lot of people into choosing a worst long-term [[credit-card]]
- "would you like ... today?" questions often make people react in a _why not?_ manner, even though they did not plan on buying the additional [[goods-and-services]]
- when one runs out of storage on Google Drive, the platform offers the user a 1-month free trail of 100GB of storage. however, it is crucial to understand that having always had 15GB of storage is way simpler than having to go back from 100GB when the free trail expires. consequently, customers who blindly clicked the _accept_ buttom must continue to pay to prevent their files from getting deleted
