Produce [[goods-and-services]]

> **definition**: _Productivity_ is the quantity of [[goods-and-services]] produced from each hour of a worker’s [[time]]

### Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money

[[inflation]]

### Society Faces a Short-Run Tradeoff between Inflation and Unemployment

this short-run tradeoff plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle

> **definition**: _Business Cycle_ is the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured by the production of [[goods-and-services]] or the number of people employed

## Macro VS Micro
