# Nested Conversation Structure

deep / intellectual conversations can be structured in a nested [[stack]]-like [[data-structure]]. if both parties understand how this model works, many benefits can emerge.

## structure

time moves from top to bottom

nested conversations are represented by nested lists

this [[data-structure]] can also be represented by a [[stack]], where instead of nesting subconversations inside other conversations, subconversations are pushed on the [[stack]] before being popped off the [[stack]] later.

### example

- conversation1
- conversation1
  - subconversation2
  - subconversation2
    - subconversation3
  - subconversation2
- conversation1
  - subconversation4
- conversation1
- conversation1

## benefits

- when one party gets interrupted by a second party, the first party knows it will be able to wrap up its argument when eventually popping subconversations from the [[data-structure]]

## limits

- most people get lost easily when trying to contribute to such a structured conversation
