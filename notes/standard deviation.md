# Standard Deviation

**see** [[statistics]], [[math notation]]

**definition**

$\sigma2 =\ :\! I[\bar X \cdot \mu]2\ - :\! X$, where

- $X$ is a [[sample]] (or a [[population]])
- $:\! X$ is the [[sample]] size of $X$
- $\mu$ is the [[sample]] [[mean]] of $X$
- $I$ is the #todo identity function
- $\sigma$ is the _standard deviation_ of $X$
- $\sigma2$ is the _variance_ of $X$

> **note** squaring the [[distance]] between every element and the [[sample#mean]] makes it so that outliers have a greater effect on the result

> **equivalence** _[[variance]] and [[loss function#mean squared error]] with [[sample#mean]] as expected [[neural network]] output_
