# Standard Deviation

**see** [[statistics]], [[math notation]]

**definition**

**`\s2 = {:--#} [X.\m]2`**

- **`X`** is a [[sample]] or a [[population]] as a [[list]]
- **`\m`** is the [[sample]] [[mean]] of **`X`**
- **`\s`** is the _standard deviation_ of **`X`**
- **`\s2`** is the _variance_ of **`X`**

> **note** squaring the [[distance]] between every element and the [[sample]] [[mean]] makes it so that outliers have a greater effect on the result

> **equivalence** _[[variance]] and [[loss function#mean squared error]] with [[sample#mean]] as expected [[neural network]] output_
