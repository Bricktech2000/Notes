# Standard Deviation

**see** [[statistics]], [[math notation]]

**definition**

$\sigma2 = (\,: - \#)\ [X \cdot \mu]2$

- $X$ is a [[sample]] or a [[population]] as a [[list]]
- $\mu$ is the [[sample]] [[mean]] of $X$
- $\sigma$ is the _standard deviation_ of $X$
- $\sigma2$ is the _variance_ of $X$

> **note** squaring the [[distance]] between every element and the [[sample]] [[mean]] makes it so that outliers have a greater effect on the result

> **equivalence** _[[variance]] and [[loss function#mean squared error]] with [[sample#mean]] as expected [[neural network]] output_

> **note** as a rule of thumb, in a [[probability distribution#normal distribution]],
>
> - $68\text-100$ of the values are within $1 \sigma$ of the [[mean]]
> - $95\text-100$ of the values are within $2 \sigma$ of the [[mean]]
> - $99\ 7\text-1000$ of the values are within $3 \sigma$ of the [[mean]]
