# Standard Deviation

**see** [[statistics]]

**definition**

$\sigma^2 = \frac + \# (X - \mu)^2$

- $X$ is a [[sample]] or a [[population]]
- $\mu$ is the [[sample]] [[mean]] of $X$
- $\sigma$ is the _standard deviation_ of $X$
- $\sigma^2$ is the _variance_ of $X$

> **note** squaring the [[distance]] between every element and the [[sample]] [[mean]] makes it so that outliers have a greater effect on the result

**definition** $\sqrt{{\frac + \#} \cdot^2}\ (X - \mu)$ the _quadratic [[mean]]_ of distances from the [[sample]] [[mean]] --- me and <https://youtu.be/V1_4nNm8a6w?t=496>

**equiv** _[[variance]] and [[loss function#mean squared error]] with [[sample]] [[mean]] as expected [[neural network]] output_
