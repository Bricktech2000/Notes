# Drawing a Molecule

see [[bond]], [[lewis-structure]], [[molecular-geometry]], [[expanded-octet]], [[resonance-structure]], [[formal-charge]], [[orbital]], [[quantum-numbers]], and why not [[rhetorical-question]]s and [[exclamation-mark]]s while we're at it

## finding the [[molecular-geometry]]

use the right [[molecular-geometry]] based on the number of atoms in the molecule

## choosing the right [[resonance-structure]]

each molecule could take the form of multiple [[resonance-structure]]s when double [[bond]]s are present. the preferred molecule is the one with preferred [[formal-charge]]s. if multiple [[resonance-structure]]s have the same lowest [[formal-charge]], then the actual molecule is the average of all those [[resonance-structure]]s.

### example

$SO_3$ could have one double bond, two double bonds or three double bonds. however, when using three double bonds, the formal charges of all $O$ atoms and of the $S$ atom are all $0$, which is preferred. for this reason, $SO_3$ has three double bonds.

## drawing using [[lewis-structure]]

_each bond is two electrons_

follow [[lewis-structure]]: draw bonds as lines and lone electrons as dots. respect molecular geometries.
