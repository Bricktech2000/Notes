# Extremum

see [[inflection-point]], [[math-notation]]

> extrema (the plural of extremum), are the largest and smallest value of the function, either within a given range (the local or relative extrema), or on the entire domain (the global or absolute extrema). &mdash; Wikipedia

## definition

the extrema of a function $f$ are defined as follows:

$\delta\ f\ x - \delta x = 0$, where

$x$ are the $x$ coordinates of the extrema of $f$

## Second Derivative Test

_verifies whether an extremum is a maximum or a minimum_

see [[calculus-notation]]

- the point is a minimum if $\delta\ (\delta f\ x - \delta x) - \delta x > 0$
- the point is a maximum if $\delta\ (\delta f\ x - \delta x) - \delta x < 0$
