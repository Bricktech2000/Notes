# Perfectionism VS High Standards

a lot of people seem to misinterpret high standards as perfectionism. I believe I have higher standards than most people, which can lead to many believing I am a perfectionist.

perfectionism is defined as _refusing to accept any standard short of perfection_.

high standards are defined as _the quality of being outstanding or extremely good_.
