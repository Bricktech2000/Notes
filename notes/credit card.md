# Credit Card

**see** [[math notation]]

**pros** _advantages of [[credit card]]s over debit cards_

- it can be said that [[credit card]]s allow for small [[loan]]s without having to go to the [[bank]]
- debit cards are essentially non-revolving credit cards, which means that their interchange fees could end up being higher as those fees are their only source of revenue
- [[credit card]]s allow for higher security as the payment to merchants is delayed by a few days. they have better fraud protection (often done through the use of AI)
- debit cards aren't always accepted as a form of online payment for e-commerce (online shopping)
- [[credit card]]s can be used to build and maintain a credit score, which makes getting large [[loan]]s at the [[bank]] easier
- debit cards don't have the same perks as [[credit card]]s

**cons** _disadvantages of [[credit card]]s_

- they make it very easy to fall into debt if used irresponsibly

## [[fact]]s about credit cards

- [[credit card]] companies make **`65-100 ... 80-100`** of their profits through revolving debt (through late fees)
- in America, **`40-100`** of consumers are transactors (pay their bill every month, also called _deadbeats_ from the banker's point of view), **`40-100`** are revolvers, and the rest do not own a [[credit card]]. the fourth type of consumer is known as the _hacker_ (takes advantage of [[credit card]] rewards)
- a processing fee is charged to the merchant for every transaction (around **`2-100 ... 4-100`**). merchants sometimes raise their prices to cover merchant fees
- APR fees (also known as _interest rates_) are the fees charged by the [[bank]] to the [[credit card]] holder. they range from **`12-100 ... 23-100`** and are on average **`16-100`** (which is huge!). interest compounds month to month: "you pay interest on the interest"
- **`30-100`** of americans could not cover a **`400 \$\`** emergency expense (see emergency fund, [[life-long investing]]). the next best option is credit
- the main things that trigger a bankruptcy filing include someone getting sick, someone losing their job, or a divorce. most American families can deal with their [[credit card]] debt. but when they do stumble, they get entirely tangled up in the high interest rates and fees.
- "I shouldn't get this new phone, I can't afford it... I mean... oh well I'll pay it later anyway." this is the mentality that can prove very dangerous to a consumer's [[finance]]ial situation
- **`73-100`** of consumers think that roll-over "makes it easier". this seems to me like a flawed way to manage [[money]]
