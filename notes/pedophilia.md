# Pedophilia

[[pedophilia]] should not be equated with compulsive [[psychopathy]]c behavior. a _minor-attracted person_ (MAP) is a pedophile that wants to cause no harm and thus has never and hopes to never abuse children, and the focus is on providing them support so they remain free of offending. sober alcoholics are not shamed for having a problem but rather are praised for working on overcoming it, and there exists a world where the same goes for non-offending pedophiles. --- <https://youtu.be/YI1FbKbBsbc>
