# Invent

**see** [[discover]]

the [[invent]]ed forms a floor of [[abstraction]]. [[invent]]ing just enough and we find ourselves [[discover]]ing; [[invent]]ing too much and we find ourselves erecting walls. [[discover]]y is [[difficult]] and beautiful; [[invent]]ion is the lazy way out

_special-case the simplest use-case_ and "hard-coding everything" are telltale signs of [[invent]]ion. often, [[invent]]ion stems from some sort of failure to generalize. getting stuck because of an [[invent]]ion of someone else's is particularily frustrating

> **examples**
>
> - instead of [[discover]]ing iterators, [[go]] [[invent]]ed them, resulting in the `range` keyword --- <https://go.dev/ref/spec#For_range>
> - [[conventional math notation]] exhibits _special-case the simplest use-case_: instead of building on strong foundations, people keep making up new notation for anything they want to express
