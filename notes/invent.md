# Invent

**see** [[discover]]

the [[invent]]ed forms a floor of [[abstraction]]. [[invent]]ing just enough and we find ourselves [[discover]]ing; [[invent]]ing too much and we find ourselves erecting walls. [[discover]]y is difficult and beautiful; [[invent]]ion is the lazy way out

> **examples**
>
> - instead of [[discover]]ing iterators, [[go]] [[invent]]ed them, resulting in the `range` keyword
