[[tool#scope]]s are about transferability and durability

_transient and artificial pieces of knowledge_

_durable concepts_

_underpinned by foundational aspects of [...] physics_

brand new shiny hyped-up technologies are over-valued stocks; it follows that [[invest]]ing [[time]] and [[energy]] into [[learning]] new shiny hyped-up technologies corresponds to [[invest]]ing [[money]] in over-valued stocks in the [[stock market]]. _sure you can make a quick buck, but it's likely the whole thing will soon start sliding from under your feet._

[[learning]] is an [[invest]]ment in yourself. make the most out of it

Straight quotes are a typewriter habit. <https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html> straight quotes exist because typewritters and [[ascii]] limited space. curly more legible; use curly. Vim digraphs `'6` `'9` `"6` `"9`

resource use one space betw sentences <https://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html>

resource use of the semicolon <https://practicaltypography.com/semicolons-and-colons.html>

#todo hyphen en dash en dash <https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html>. en dash: dunning-kruger, backus-naur, price-value sigmoid, sign-magnitude notation, curry-howard correspondence/isomorphism, slope-intercept?, point-slope?, hindu-arabic, gauss-seidel, catmull-rom. what about `&bull;` and `&times;`?

#todo unrelated but `:set fo+=ta tw=80`

#xxx testing: Dunning--Kruger effect --- <https://practicaltypography.com/ellipses.html> #todo turn on `smarty` on website? `ltrep -s '\&\w+;&~\&mdash;&~\&bull;' **.md` and `ltrep -FH '...' **.md` and `ltrep '[rs]\. [A-Z]'`
