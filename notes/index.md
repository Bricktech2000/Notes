#xxx logic

#xxx during rewatch, make sure to define what a model is

_models_ (assignment of truth values to symbols)
_resolution_ is an inference rule that is both sound and complete
a clause is a disjunction of a bunch of literals (literals are symbol and Â¬symbol) --- <https://youtu.be/egLAF4dFdBo?t=326>

| formulas allowed                           | inference rule | soundness | completeness |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| propositional logic                        | modus ponens   | yes       | no           |
| propositional logic with only Horn clauses | modus ponens   | yes       | yes          |
| propositional logic                        | resolution     | yes       | yes          |
