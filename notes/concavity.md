# Concavity

see [[math-notation]]

## definition

see [[extremum]], [[calculus-notation]]

$f\ x$ is _concave up_ at $x$ if $\delta\ (\delta f\ x - \delta x) - \delta x < 0$, it _bends upwards_

$f\ x$ is _concave down_ at $x$ if $\delta\ (\delta f\ x - \delta x) - \delta x > 0$, it _bends downwards_

## properties

A point where the concavity changes (from up to down or down to up) is an [[inflection-point]]
