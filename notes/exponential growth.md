# Exponential Growth

_our inability to intuitively understand [[exponential growth]]_

**see** [[exponent]], [[math notation]]

[[line]]ar growth is intuitive to us, but [[exponent]]ial growth is incomprehensible to us. our [[brain]]s just didn't evolve an intuition for [[exponential growth]] because it wasn't needed for survival

> **examples**
>
> - folding a piece of paper in half **`50`** times will make it so thick it would nearly reach the sun, which is unintuitive to us
> - a **`5-100`** [[inflation]] rate doesn't seem so bad, but your [[money]] being worth half as much in **`14`** years sounds like a disaster
