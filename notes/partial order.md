**equiv** _set of paths of a directed acyclic [[graph]]_ --- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Relation_to_partial_orders> and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Linear_extension>

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _non-strict partial order_ or simply _partial order_ if it is a [[relation#antisymmetric relation]], a [[relation#reflexive relation]] and a [[relation#transitive relation]]

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _non-strict partial order_ or simply _partial order_ if it is a non-strict [[preorder]] and a [[relation#antisymmetric relation]]

> **example** _less than or equal to_ is a non-strict [[partial order]] and therefore a non-strict [[preorder]] on the [[set]] of [[real]]s

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _strict partial order_ if it is a [[relation#asymmetric relation]], a [[relation#irreflexive relation]] and a [[relation#transitive relation]]

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _strict partial order_ if it is a strict [[preorder]] and a [[relation#asymmetric relation]]

**definition** a [[relation]] is a _strict partial order_ if it is a strict [[preorder]]

> **example** _less than_ is a strict [[partial order]] and equivalently a strict [[preorder]] on the [[set]] of [[real]]s

**equiv** _strict [[preorder]]_
