## Standard Product of Sums

[[iti1100-a-digital-systems-i]] equivalent of a [[conjunctive-normal-form]]. the disjunctive clauses are know as _Maxterms_

Products of Sums can be used to easily convert a [[boolean-expression]] to only NAND [[gate]]s by double-negating the [[boolean-expression]] and distributing one of the negations. note that $\lnot A =\lnot (A \land A)$, see [[boolean-operator]]s
