# Quantifier

**see** [[math notation]], [[boolean algebra]]

**definition** in [[boolean algebra]], a _quantifier_ is an [[operator]] that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula &mdash; Wikipedia

> **note** an _open formula_ is an expression with at least one free [[variable]], see [[linear system]]

**properties**

$B < C =\!= +B \lor C$ means “for all $B$, $C$”. negating, we get $+ (B < C) =\!= B \land +C$, which means “there exists a $B$ such that $+C$”

the inverse is also true

## Universal Quantifier

_expresses that every item in the domain satisfies a condition_

**notations**

_in my [[math notation]]_ $P\ x > \mathbb R x$

_in [[conventional math notation]]_ $\forall x \in \mathbb R, P(x)$

## Existential Quantifier

_expresses that at least one item in the domain satisfies a condition_

**notations**

_in my [[math notation]]_ $P\ x \land \mathbb R x$

_in [[conventional math notation]]_ $\exists x \in \mathbb R, P(x)$

## Uniqueness Quantifier

_in [[conventional math notation]]_

_expresses that exactly one item in the domain satisfies a condition_

**notations**

_in [[conventional math notation]]_ $\exists! x \in \mathbb R, P(x)$
