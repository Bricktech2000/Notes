# MAT2322 B Calculus III For Engineers

14.1 - 14.3

function continuity with multiple arguments

function limit with multiple arguments

limit existence on function with multiple arguments

**theorem** _clourout_ (spelled wrong #todo)

if $\partial_{xy} f$ and $\partial_{yx} f$ exist and are continuous near a point $(x_0, y_0)$, then $f_{xy}\ (x, y) = f_{yx}\ (x, y)$ for all $(x, y)$ near $(x_0, y_0)$

tangent plane equation

$z = \dots$

**theorem** _differentiability_

<!-- $f$ is differentiable at $(x_0, y_0)$ if and only if $\partial_{xy} f$ and $\partial_{yx} f$ exist and are continuous near $(x_0, y_0)$ -->

14.5

implicit differentiation

...

14.6

directional derivative and gradient vector

level curves and level surfaces

gradient vector is orthogonal to level curve and colinera to normal vector

boundaries

local extrema are at derivative = (0 or does not exit) for all partial derivatives of f
