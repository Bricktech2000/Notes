# Self-Control

**see** [[habit]], [[system]]

[[self-control]] is our **capacity to monitor internal conflict** &mdash; <https://youtu.be/dgRSfhoHE4g>. I'll repeat that again: [[self-control]] is not a thing; conflict monitoring **is** [[self-control]]. this leads to some interesting conclusions:

- we are in control as long as we are **monitoring** the conflict. telling ourselves _\*shrug\* oh well_ before giving in to unhealthy behavior is not the consequence of losing the battle, but rather the **cause** of losing the battle
- **introspection** is a necessary condition for [[self-control]]. if we are not aware of the conflict, we cannot monitor it. this is why [[journaling]], meditation, [[habit#tracking]] and _brain reprogramming_ (see [[habit#formation]]) are so powerful
- stress **externalizes** our attention, which explains why it leads to a lack of [[self-control]]. the solution is not to "reduce" stress, but rather to hit the breaks and take the [[time]] to reinternalize our awareness
- not having the [[energy]] to care about internal conflict leads to a lack of [[self-control]]. this is why [[sleep]], exercise and diet are so important

_willpower_ is unpredictable. trying to change behavior through [[self-control]] will eventually fail; trying to change behavior through [[system]]s and [[habit]]s has a greater chance of success. people who value [[stoicism]] understand this [[concept]]

> **note** recent research is starting to suggest a relationship between [[sleep]] deprivation and reduced [[self-control]] &mdash; <https://jamesclear.com/willpower>. I have observed this in myself, and have found that [[sleep]] is a [[habit#keystone habit]] of mine
