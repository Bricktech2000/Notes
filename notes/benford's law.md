# Benford's Law

**aka** _law of anomalous numbers_, _first-digit law_

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law>

**theorem** _Benford's Law_ in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small

more specifically, [[benford's law]] applies most accurately to [[probability distribution]]s that span several orders of magnitude uniformly, like [[stock market]] prices and populations of cities --- Wikipedia. examples become more sparse as the magnitude increases, and so within each order of magnitude, fewer examples have larger leading digits
