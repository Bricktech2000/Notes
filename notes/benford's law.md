# Benford's Law

**aka** _law of anomalous numbers_, _first-digit law_

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law>

**theorem** _Benford's Law_ in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small

more specifically, [[benford's law]] applies to [[probability distribution]]s that span several orders of magnitude uniformly, such as [[stock market]] prices and populations of cities; "examples become more sparse as the magnitude increases". that is, the distribution formed by the [[logarithm]]s of the examples is approximately a [[continuous uniform distribution]]. from this point of view, it is obvious that [[benford's law]] holds
