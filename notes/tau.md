# Tau

_the true [[circle]] constant_

**definition** **`tt`** is the ratio of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its radius

**definition** given a [[circle]] of radius **`r`** and of circumference **`C`**, **`tt = C -- r ~ 6 28318530-100000000`**

**tradeoffs**

[[tau]], alias **`2pp`**, appears everywhere: in the [[gaussian function]], in the [[fourier transform]], in the **`n`**th [[root of unity]]s, in [[euler's identity]], in [[trigonometric function]]s, and many more

[[tau]] plays nicely with radians; an [[angle]] in radians whose value is a [[real]] multiple of [[tau]] represents that multiple of a turn: **`-2tt"rad"`** is a half turn, **`-4tt"rad"`** is a quarter turn, and so on

the [[switching cost]] is non-negligible
