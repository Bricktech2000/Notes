# Tau

_the true circle constant_

**see** [[math notation]]

&mdash; <https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto>

**definition** $\tau$ is the ratio of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its radius

**definition** given a [[circle]] of radius $r$ and of circumference $C$, $\tau = C - r$, or approximately $6\ 28318530\text-100000000$

**pros** _compared to $\pi$_

[[tau]] (alias $2\pi$) appears everywhere: in the [[gaussian function]], in the [[fourier transform]], in the $n$th [[root of unity]]s, in [[euler's constant]] identity, in [[trigonometric function]]s, and so on

an [[angle]] in radians whose value is a [[real]] multiple of [[tau]] represents that multiple of a turn

**cons** _compared to $\pi$_

a non-negligeable [[switching cost]]
