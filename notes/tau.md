# Tau

_the true [[circle]] constant_

**see** [[math notation]]

> **resource** the [[tau]] manifesto &mdash; <https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto>

**definition** **`tt`** is the ratio of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its radius

**definition** given a [[circle]] of radius **`r`** and of circumference **`C`**, **`tt = C -- r ~ 6 28318530-100000000`**

**tradeoffs**

[[tau]], alias **`2pp`**, appears everywhere: in the [[gaussian function]], in the [[fourier transform]], in the **`n`**th [[root of unity]]s, in euler's identity (see [[euler's constant]]), in [[trigonometric function]]s, and many more

[[tau]] plays nicely with radians: an [[angle]] in radians whose value is a [[real]] multiple of [[tau]] represents that multiple of a turn

the [[switching cost]] is non-negligible
