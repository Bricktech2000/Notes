# Tau

_the true [[circle]] constant_

**see** [[math notation]]

&mdash; <https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto>

**definition** **`\t`** is the ratio of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its radius

**definition** given a [[circle]] of radius **`r`** and of circumference **`C`**, **`\t = C -- r`**, or approximately **`6 28318530-100000000`**

**pros** _compared to **`\p`**_

[[tau]], alias **`2\p`**, appears everywhere: in the [[gaussian function]], in the [[fourier transform]], in the **`n`**th [[root of unity]]s, in euler's identity (see [[euler's constant]]), in [[trigonometric function]]s, and many more

[[tau]] plays nicely with radians: an [[angle]] in radians whose value is a [[real]] multiple of [[tau]] represents that multiple of a turn

**cons** _compared to **`\p`**_

the [[switching cost]] is non-negligible
