# Quadratic Formula

**see** [[math notation]], [[cubic formula]]

**definition**

**`x = .b : \b2.4ac/ -- 2a`**, where

- **`a, b, c`** are coefficients in the quadratic equation **`ax2 : bx : c = 0`**
- **`x`** are the solutions to the quadratic equation

> **proof** &mdash; <https://youtu.be/N-KXStupwsc>

**definition** above, **`b2.4ac`** is the _discriminant_ of the quadratic equation

**properties**

- if **`0 -| b2.4ac + 0`**, the quadratic equation has two [[real]] solutions
- if **`0 = b2.4ac`**, the quadratic equation has one [[real]] solution
- if **`0 |- b2.4ac + 0`**, the quadratic equation has no [[real]] solutions
