### definitions

> **collections** are data types containing multiple elements. they cannot contain [[java-primitive]]s &mdash; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4594529/java-collections-why-no-primitive-types>. see [[java-is-a-terrible-language]]

> in Java, an **abstract method** is used to have a definition but no implementation. abstract methods must be implemented by sub[[class]]es.

> in Java, an **abstract class** is used to prevent its instantiation. it must be used when a [[class]] contains abstract methods

> in Java, declaring a [[class]] `class MyClass` is shorthand for `class MyClass extents Object`

> in Java, **generics** are almost identical to `template`s in C++. behind the scenes, they seem to replace all instances of the generic type by `Object`, but they still allow for compile-time type checks to avoid runtime errors &mdash; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48438160/how-do-java-generic-methods-work-under-the-hood>. see [[java-is-a-terrible-language]]
