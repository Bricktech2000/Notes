# Identity

_the qualities, beliefs, and personality that characterize a person or group_

every decision we make is a vote for a certain [[identity]] --- <https://youtu.be/PZ7lDrwYdZc?t=303>

> **example**
>
> - calling yourself a runner every time you go for a run is what makes you a runner
> - breaking a good [[habit]] because of [[laziness]] is what makes you someone lazy
