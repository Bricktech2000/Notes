# Comment

my rule of thumb has been to [[comment]] anything unobvious, which turns out to achive little more than hide the mess in the attic because, in principle, all code is obvious for some hypothetical reader of high enough [[intelligence]] and extensive enough [[knowledge]]. if we agree on that then any [[debate]] on the topic becomes one about favorite colors and anyone with a strong opinion can't really be taken seriously

I suppose this is an appropriate segue into my strong opinions on the matter:

- if you advocade for more readable code, a good start might be to quit writing imperative program logic like it's the 1970s
- god oh god stop enforcing invariants using [[exception]]s. there are better ways of living dangerously, like [[c]]-style pinky promises
- if you're one of the people splitting code into single-use subroutines for the purpose of self-documentation you should go burn in hell
