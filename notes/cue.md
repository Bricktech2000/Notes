## environmental dependency of learning

our behavior is highly controlled by environmental [[cue]]s &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=867>

for efficient [[learning]] and to [[focus]] more deeply, we must teach our [[brain]]s to associate a specific environment with [[learning]]

_the primary function of a bedroom is [[sleep]]ing. the primary function of a dining table is eating. the primary function of a living area is recreation and socializing_

> **example** _an example of associating a specific environment to studying_
>
> - take a lamp and put a label on it that says _study lamp_. use it **only** for studying; don't dress by it, don't snack by it, don't clean the room by it.
> - when you want to study in your room, sit down, turn on the lamp and start studying. when you wish to take a break, turn the lamp off, get up and leave the desk.
>
> this way, you're training your [[brain]] to study whenever you're seating at your desk with your study lamp on.
