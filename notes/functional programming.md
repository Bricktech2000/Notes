# Functional Programming

**see**

[[functor]] & [[map function]], [[monad]] & [[bind function]] & [[join function]], [[monoid]] & [[reduce function]], [[applicative]] & [[apply function]], [[effect type]] & [[return function]]

[[currying]], [[partial application]], [[function#pure function]] and [[function#total function]], [[combinatory logic]], [[lambda calculus]]

[[function]], [[type]], [[composition]]

[[refactoring to immutability]], [[function#total function]]

**properties**

[[functional programming]] is both _procedural_ and _functional_, see [[programming paradigm]]

functional languages support [[first-class function]]s

**tradeoffs**

as all [[function]]s are isolated from other parts of a program, they can be combined to build larger [[function]]s without having to worry about anything breaking. this also allows for testability and reusability

[[functional programming]] [[function]]s and [[object-oriented programming]] [[object]]s can be compared to Lego bricks, except the bricks in [[object-oriented programming]] are likely not going to fit with other bricks in the program, and all bricks are joined by strings and rubber bands waiting to become a fragile tangled mess
