# Type Composition

> **resource** put one space between sentences <https://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html>

I started paying more attention to the characters I write with after a swift shift in mindset: typographic characters aren't fancier [[ascii]] characters; rather, [[ascii]] characters are lazy approximations of typographic characters. typography far predates [[ascii]]

| name (from `:h dig`)         | character | [[ascii]] approximation |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| horizontal ellipsis          | …         | ...                     |
| double quotation marks       | “ ”       | " "                     |
| single quotation marks       | ‘ ’       | ' '                     |
| single angle quotation marks | ‹ ›       | < >                     |
| prime and double prime       | ′ ″       | ' "                     |
| en dash                      | –         | --                      |
| em dash                      | —         | ---                     |
| rightwards arrow             | →         | ->                      |
| long rightwards arrow        | ⟶         | -->                     |
| multiplication sign          | ×         | x                       |
| minus sign                   | −         | -                       |
| dot operator                 | ⋅         | .                       |
| parallel to                  | ∥         | \|\|                    |
| no-break space               |           |                         |

- apostrophes `’` are right single quotation marks --- <https://practicaltypography.com/apostrophes.html>
- feet and inches `5′4″` and arcminutes and arcseconds `34°47′52″` use prime `′` and double prime `″` marks --- <https://practicaltypography.com/foot-and-inch-marks.html>
- nonbreaking spaces ` ` prevent line breaks --- <https://practicaltypography.com/nonbreaking-spaces.html>. their use boils down to common sense---but don't forget they exist
- straight quotes `" '` exist because typewriters had limited character sets; don't use them, ever --- <https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html>
- the semicolon `;` separates list items that contain commas and is used instead of a conjunction to separate sentences --- <https://practicaltypography.com/semicolons-and-colons.html>
- parentheses `()` separate asides from body text and brackets `[]` denote changes in quoted material; braces `{}` are rarely used --- <https://practicaltypography.com/parentheses-brackets-and-braces.html>
- the hyphen `-` is used in phrasal adjectives for clarity and in some multi-part words --- <https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html>. don't hyphenate adverbs or complements
- the en dash `–` denotes ranges of values or a connection or contrast between pairs of words. don't use a slash when an en dash is correct --- <https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html>
- the em dash `—` introduces a break between parts of a sentence --- <https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html> and is used for interrupted dialogue --- <https://practicaltypography.com/ellipses.html>
