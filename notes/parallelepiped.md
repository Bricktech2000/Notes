# Parallelepiped

_a 3-dimensional parallelogram_

## volume of the [[parallelepiped]] defined by 3 [[euclidean vector]]s in **`RR^3`**

does this seem random and pointless? well, it is

**see** [[dot product]], [[cross product]]

**`V = :(u "cross" v)w`** (see [[dot product]], [[cross product]]), where

- **`V`** is the [[volume]] to be calculated
- **`u, v, w`** are the three [[euclidean vector]]s in **`RR^3`**

this works because **`:(u "cross" v)w = "det" []|| & || & || && w & u & v && || & || & ||[]`**, see [[determinant]] --- <https://youtu.be/BaM7OCEm3G0?t=590>
