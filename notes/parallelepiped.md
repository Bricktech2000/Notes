# Parallelepiped

_a 3-dimensional parallelogram_

## volume of the [[parallelepiped]] defined by 3 vectors in $\mathbb R^3$

_does this seem random and pointless? well, it is._

**see** [[dot product]], [[cross product]]

$V = |:\! (u\ \check\mid\ v) w|$ (see [[dot product]], [[cross product]]), where

- $V$ is the [[volume]] to be calculated
- $u, v, w$ are the three [[vector in rn]]3
