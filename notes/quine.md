# Quine

_a program that outputs its own listing_

[[quine]]s are not the result of language-specific hacks; they exist, up to practical interpretation of program output, in every [[turing complete]] [[programming language]] for which there exists a total computable [[function]] that maps programs to their listings, as follows from the _fixed-point theorem_

>   if snd:

**representation** _constructive quine_

```python
intron = '''modify me and this program remains a quine'''
data = '''
quote = "'" * 3
# output a reconstruction of the intron in the format used above
print(f'intron = {quote}{intron}{quote}')
# output a reconstruction of the data in the format used above
print(f'data = {quote}{data}{quote}')
# output the data again as-is to produce the rest of the program
print(data)'''

quote = "'" * 3
# output a reconstruction of the intron in the format used above
print(f'intron = {quote}{intron}{quote}')
# output a reconstruction of the data in the format used above
print(f'data = {quote}{data}{quote}')
# output the data again as-is to produce the rest of the program
print(data)
```

**theorem** _s-m-n theorem_ [[partial application]] on computable [[function]]s is computable and outputs computable [[function]]s

**theorem** _fixed-point theorem_ any total computable [[function]] from programs to programs has a fixed point

> **proof** apply the _s-m-n theorem_ to the structure of the [[combinator#y combinator]] --- <http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html#sec_fp>.

_The fixed-point theorem has other amusing applications. Essentially, its intuitive (and effective) content is that [...] adding to a programming language the ability for a program to manipulate itself (its source code) does not add to its expressive power._ --- <http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html#sec_fp>. intuitively, performing Î²-reduction "running the program" on the [[combinator#y combinator]] gives back the transformation **`f`** applied to the original &lambda;-term (that is, a manipulation of its own source code)

I believe this statement may be incorrect

> on another note, _[...] by a computable function of the string as program [...]_ appears redundant because the [[composition#identity]] is computable and therefore by the _s-m-n theorem_ we have that there indeed exists a computable [[function]] that maps any [[string]] to a computable program that outputs that [[string]]
