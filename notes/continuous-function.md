# Continuous Function

see [[math-notation]]

> a function is continuous at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a} f\ x = f\ a$. both must be [[limit-that-exists]].

> a function is continuous **from the left** at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a^-} f\ x = f\ a$. both must be [[limit-that-exists]]

> a function is continuous **from the right** at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a^+} f\ x = f\ a$. both must be [[limit-that-exists]]

## theorem

if $f\ x$ and $g\ x$ are continuous at $a$, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$:

- $f \dot \circ g$
- $f'g$
- $c f$ where $c$ is a constant
- $f \text- g$ if $g\ a \ne 0$
