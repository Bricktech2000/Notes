# Steer over Drift

**see** [[luck]]

the majority of people drift through life; that is, they do not have plans, do not have [[goal]]s, do not have ambition, and simply drift around getting pushed by the current. they are not in control of their lives. contrastingly, the remaining minority of people decide to [[focus]] on what they have control over rather than what they do not; that is, they steer their way around life. they never blame their circumstances, and rather focus on what they can do to improve their situation. they are in control of their lives
