**see** [[math notation]]

[[iso 216]] paper sizes are defined to have an aspect ratio of **`\2/ -- 1`**. their dimensions can then be defined inductively as follows:

- **`A 0`** paper has an area of **`1 "m"2`**, and **`A (n:1)`** paper has half the area of **`A n`** paper
- **`B 0`** paper has a width of **`1 "m"2`**, and **`B (n:1)`** paper has half the area of **`B n`** paper

**properties**

**`B n |- A n`**, for all **`n`**

**`B`**-series paper sizes are defined as the geometric [[mean]] of two successive **`A`**-series paper sizes

**`\2/ -- 1`** is the only aspect ratio that allows folding a sheet of paper in half to produce a sheet of paper of the same aspect ratio

> **proof** let an **`A 0`** sheet of size **`(L, l)`**. then, an **`A 1`** sheet will be of size **`(l, L-2)`**. therefore, **`L -- l = l -- L-2 == L2-2 = l2 == L -- l = \2/`** --- me
