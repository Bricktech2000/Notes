# Sample

**see** [[inferential statistics]], [[math notation]], [[population]]

_a [[list]] of mathematical objects_

**definition** a _sample_ is a [[multiset#multisubset]] of a [[population]] and therefore a [[multiset]] of _examples_

**properties**

a random [[sample]] tends to exhibit the same properties as the [[population]] from which it was drawn

## Probability Sampling

&mdash; <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch13/prob/5214899-eng.htm>

**definition** _probability sampling_ is a method of [[sample#sampling]] in which each member of the [[population]] has a known, non-zero probability of being selected in the [[sample]] &mdash; Github Copilot

**properties**

probability sampling is more complex, more time-consuming and usually more costly than non-probability sampling

**pros & cons**

estimates produced by probability sampling are more accurate than those produced by non-probability sampling

### Simple Random Sampling

**definition** _simple random sampling_ is a method of [[sample#probability sampling]] in which each member of the [[population]] has an equal chance of being selected in the [[sample]] &mdash; Github Copilot

> **note** simple random sampling can be done with or without replacement (with or without the possibility of a member of the [[population]] being selected more than once)

**properties**

simple random sampling without replacement is usually more convenient and gives more precise estimates than simple random sampling with replacement

**pros & cons**

simple random sampling does not require any information about the [[population]]

formulas for calculating the [[sample#size]] required for simple random sampling are relatively simple

### Stratified Sampling

**definition** _stratified sampling_ is a method of [[sample#probability sampling]] in which the [[population]] is divided into disjoint subgroups called _strata_, from each of which a [[sample]] is selected &mdash; Github Copilot

**pros & cons**

stratified sampling ensures than each stratum is represented in the [[sample]] in proportion to its size in the [[population]]

stratified sampling requires data on the [[population]] in order to divide it into strata
