# Loss Function

**see** [[math notation]], [[function]], [[neural network]]

## Mean Squared Error

_the default [[loss function]] for regression problems_

> Mathematically, it is the preferred loss function under the inference framework of maximum likelihood if the distribution of the target [[variable]] is Gaussian. It is the [[loss function]] to be evaluated first and only changed if you have a good reason. &mdash; <https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks/>

**definition**

$\text{MSE} = \ :\! [y \cdot \hat y]2 - \#\ y$, where

- $\text{MSE}$ is the _mean squared error_ of the values
- $y$ are the observed values
- $\hat y$ are the predicted values
