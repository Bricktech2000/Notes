# Pain

[[pain]] motivates us to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain>. [[pain]] is an essential warning signal that helps us protect ourselves from injury

## congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis

_CIPA_ is a rare genetic disorder (17 documentated cases in the United States) affecting the [[autonomic nervous system]] which prevents the feeling of [[pain]] and [[temperature]] and which is often accompanied by [[intellectual disability]]. the inability to feel [[pain]] leads to repeated injuries, including:

- self-mutilation, including oral mutilation and biting of fingertips
- bruising, scarring, and infection of the skin
- multiple bone fractures, many of which fail to heal properly
- recurrent joint dislocations resulting in joint deformity

this is a life-threatening condition, with many patients never reaching adulthood
