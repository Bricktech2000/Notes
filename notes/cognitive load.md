# Cognitive Load

_the amount of working memory resources used to process information_

**see** [[habit]], [[sleep]], [[zeigarnik effect]]

[[cognitive load]] consists of incomplete tasks "running in the background", taking up bandwidth and consuming [[energy]]. David Allen calls this a _thought loop_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/q5udGQj4iVY?t=112>

> **examples**
>
> - "I need to call Alice on Thursday"
> - "that comment he made really bugged me"
> - "I need to get milk on the way home"
> - "why did she lie to them?"

## Reduction

[[cognitive load#reduction]] in everyday life is a great way to increase [[productivity]]. constantly having to think about everything you have to do is a waste of [[time]] and [[energy]] &mdash; me and <https://youtu.be/bP8wTapHsbc?t=52>

> **examples** _methods of [[cognitive load#reduction]]_
>
> - running your life on a calendar so you don't have to constantly think about what you have to do
> - capturing ideas in a notebook as soon as they come to you so you don't have to keep thinking about them
> - writing down (or using [[memory technique]]s to temporarily memorize) incomplete tasks to get them off you mind
> - [[journaling]] before [[sleep]] to get thoughts out of your head, referred to as a _brain dump_
