[[programming paradigm]]s can be represented as follows:

|                | **Procedural**             | **Object-Oriented**             |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Imperative** | [[procedural programming]] | [[object-oriented programming]] |
| **Functional** | [[functional programming]] |                                 |

where

- _procedural code_ has no explicit association between data [[type]]s and [[function]]s
- _object-oriented code_ has explicit associations between data [[type]]s and [[function]]s
- _imperative code_ has no specific method of handling of shared state or side effects
- _functional code_ is pure and does not have to deal with shared state or side effects, see [[function]]
