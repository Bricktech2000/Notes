it is very important to delegate as much as possible to other people so you can focus on growing the [[business]]. here is a sample hierarchy for a small [[business]]:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A(Owner)
  D(Executive Assistant)

  subgraph Head
    A --- D
  end
```

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(Head)
  B(Production Manager)
  C(Sales Manager)

  A --> B
  A --> C
  B --> B1(Crew)
  B --> B2(Crew)
  B --> B3(Crew)
  C --> C1(Estimator)
  C --> C2(Marketer)
  C --> C3(Closer)
```

[[time]] is a very valuable asset. making the most of it is very important. see [[productivity]]
