_when a square root is in the denominator_

**see** [[math notation]]

> if the denominator is of the form **`\a/`**, multiply the fraction by **`\a/ -- \a/`**
>
> if the denominator is of the form **`\a/ : \b/`**, multiply the fraction by **`\a/ . \b/ -- \a/ . \b/`**

> if the denominator is of the form **`\a/ . \b/`**, multiply the fraction by **`\a/ : \b/ -- \a/ : \b/`**
