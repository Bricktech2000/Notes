# Level Curve

**definition** the _level curves_ of a [[function]] **`f`** is defined as **`S_f k == f (x ...) = k`**

let **`p`** be a point and **`f`** a [[function]]. then, the [[normal vector]] **`n`** of a [[plane]] tangent to the [[level curve]] of **`f`** at **`p`** is defined as

**`n = dd f p -- dd p`**, see [[gradient]]

and said [[plane]] **`T`** tangent to the [[level curve]] at **`p`** is defined as

**`T t == :n(t.p) = 0`**, see [[vector in rn]], [[plane]], [[dot product]]
