# Gamma Correction

**see** [[color science]], [[math notation]]

**definition** _gamma correction_ is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode [[luminance]] or whole [[color space]]s in video or still image systems &mdash; Wikipedia

[[gamma correction]] allows for the efficient [[compression]] of [[color]] data into [[binary]] data by taking advantage of the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to low [[luminance]] than to high [[luminance]], see [[lightness]]

**definition**

**`V_"out" = A | [V_"in"]gg`**, where

- **`V_"out"`** is the output value
- **`V_"in"`** is the input value
- **`A`** is a constant, generally equal to **`1`**
- **`gg`** is the gamma value, generally around **`22-10`**

**representation** _the gamma [[curve]] and [[lightness]]_
