# Gamma Correction

**see** [[color science]]

**definition** _gamma correction_ is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode [[luminance]] or whole [[color space]]s in video or still image systems --- Wikipedia

[[gamma correction]] allows for the efficient [[data compression]] of [[color]] data into [[binary]] data by taking advantage of the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to low [[luminance]] than to high [[luminance]], see [[lightness]]

**definition**

$V_\mathrm{out} = A \cdot V_\mathrm{in}^\gamma$, where

- $V_\mathrm{out}$ is the output value
- $V_\mathrm{in}$ is the input value
- $A$ is a constant, generally set to $1$
- $\gamma$ is the gamma value, generally around $2.2$
