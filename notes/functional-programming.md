## philosophy

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/Nrp_LZ-XGsY>

design functions that do one thing well

design functions to work together

as all [[function]]s are isolated from any other parts of a program, they can be combined to build larger functions without having to worry about anything breaking

[[functional-programming]] [[function]]s and [[object-oriented-programming]] [[object]]s can be compared to Lego bricks, except bricks in [[object-oriented-programming]] are likely not going to fit with other bricks in the program, and all bricks are joined by strings and rubber bands wating to become a fragile tangled mess.
