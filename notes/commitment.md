# Commitment

**definition** a _commitment_ is an implicit or explicit agreement to meeting an [[expectation]]

> **example** _an implicit commitment_ Chris makes coffee for his wife every morning. even though there is no explicit agreement, not making coffee one morning would be a breach of [[commitment]]

> **example** dishonesty is the breach of the implicit [[commitment]] to honesty, which is a breach of [[integrity]]

not fulfilling a [[commitment]] is a breach of [[integrity]]. keeping people updated on the status of a [[commitment]] is one way to maintain [[integrity]] when [[expectation]]s are not met. when [[integrity]] is breached, it is important to reflect on the situation and "restore" [[integrity]]

> **procedure** _"restoring" [[integrity]]_
>
> 1. identify the [[commitment]] that was not fulfilled
> 2. analyze events leading to the [[commitment]] not being fulfilled
> 3. understand the the consequences of not fulfilling the [[commitment]]
> 4. explore solutions to ensure future fulfillment of the [[commitment]]
