> [[trick]]s I used to make this experience successful include:
>
> - understanding that for [[hypnosis]] to work, the subject must be willing to be hypnotized
> - eliminating distractions by wearing headphones and sitting comfortably on a couch in a dark and quiet room
> - attempting the experience multiple times until I felt relaxed enough to be hypnotized
>
> when I entered the hypnotic state, I felt like I was no longer in that room and was able to stop feeling physical sensations to [[focus]] entirely on the hypnotist's voice

> - asking the subject to focus on an object and telling that you words are making them feel tired --- it is tiring for our eyes to focus on an object for an extended time --- <https://youtu.be/tXIRq6LxYFk?t=580>
> - telling the subject to drop deeper into their state of relaxation --- you drop their hand down and let it hang loosely so they actually feel more relaxed --- <https://youtu.be/47RAZ2eEdhA?t=61>
> - looking like you know what you are doing --- speaking confidently, and acting as if a trick worked when it doesn't and using another technique to convince the subject further --- <https://youtu.be/47RAZ2eEdhA?t=151>
