[[hypnosis]] might just be nothing more than _convincing the subject that the hypnotist has control over [them]_ --- <https://youtu.be/tXIRq6LxYFk?t=5m57s>. by the [[power of belief]], hypnotic inductions sounding convincing enough is sufficient for making them work

common techniques include --- with explanations:

- asking the subject to look up then close their eyes and telling them you glued them shut --- it is harder to open our eyes while looking up --- <https://youtu.be/tXIRq6LxYFk?t=436>
- asking the subject to focus on an object and telling that you words are making them tired --- it is tiring for our eyes to focus on an object for a long time --- <https://youtu.be/tXIRq6LxYFk?t=580>
- telling the subject to drop deeper into their state of relaxation --- you drop their hand down and let it hang loosely so they actually feel more relaxed --- <https://youtu.be/47RAZ2eEdhA?t=61>
- looking like you know what you are doing --- speaking confidently, and acting as if a trick worked when it didn't and using another technique to convince the subject further --- <https://youtu.be/47RAZ2eEdhA?t=151>

surprise can also be used to incease a subject's responsiveness to suggestion. this is most effective when the subject is focused and relaxed, gets surprised, and is given a suggestion an eight of a second later --- <https://youtu.be/eDqpWJ-Zcw0>
