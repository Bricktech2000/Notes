> [[trick]]s I used to make this experience successful include:
>
> - understanding that for [[hypnosis]] to work, the subject must be willing to be hypnotized
> - eliminating distractions by wearing headphones and sitting comfortably on a couch in a dark and quiet room
> - attempting the experience multiple times until I felt relaxed enough to be hypnotized
