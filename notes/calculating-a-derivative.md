# Calculating a Derivative

see [[derivative-rules]], [[limit-rules]], [[calculating-a-limit]], [[logarithmic-differentiation]]

## Differentiation

apply [[derivative-rules]] recursively. see [[logarithmic-differentiation]]

## Implicit Differentiation

> Derivation of an implicit equation (where the dependent variable is not isolated). Works with both functions and relations that aren't functions. [[complete]]

### example

$x2 \cdot y2 = 2$

$d\text-dx\ |\ x2 \cdot y2 = d\text-dx\ |\ 2$

$2x \cdot 2y'dy \text- dx = 0$

$dy \text- dx = \circ x \text- y$
