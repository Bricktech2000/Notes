# Sunk Costs Fallacy

_the escalation of commitment_

**definition** the _sunk costs fallacy_ is a [[cognitive bias]] characterized by the tendency to continue a course of action because of the [[time]], [[money]] and [[energy]] already [[invest]]ed in it, even if it is no longer the best course of action &mdash; GitHub Copilot

the [[sunk costs fallacy]] is a _logical fallacy_ &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases>

> **examples**
>
> - not letting a failing project go because of the [[time]] and [[money]] already invested
> - continuing to watch a bad movie because you've already paid for the ticket

> **note** the [[sunk costs fallacy]] may be a [[proxy#pursuit]]. making an [[invest]]ment and it not working out feels uncomfortable, a consequence of evolution. we suppress the discomfort, the [[proxy]], by pretending the investment was still worth it, giving rise to the [[sunk costs fallacy]]
