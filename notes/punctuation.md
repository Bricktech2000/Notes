# Punctuation

## best practices

in [[technical-writing]]

_course's objective_ is awkward to say (uses possessive grammar) whereas _course objective_ is better (uses an adjective)

a serial comma (Oxford comma) before an _and_ or an _or_ at the end of an enumeration is not wrong (but not required)

use vivid, descriptive, subject-specific language (avoid _good, thing, etc._)

generally, a semicolon `;` is used instead of a period to indicate that two sentences are closely related

a `-` is a [[hyphen]] (_well-written_) whereas a `--` is a [[dash]] (_his report is excellent &mdash; clear, concise and informative_)
