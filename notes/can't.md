# Can't

_can't_ is a very dangerous word. it represents the belief that there exists some mystical external force preventing you from doing something. however, more often than not, reflecting on what that external force actually is will reveal that you can still be in control of the situation.

## I don't have time

**aka** _I don't deem this important enough to make [[time]] for_

everyone has $24 \text{h}$ to work with every day. if something were **actually** important to you, you would make [[time]] for it &mdash; Ali Abdaal (if I remember correctly)

## I can't afford it

**aka** _I'm indifferent to being powerless when it comes to my [[wealth]]_

> **note** this powerlessness is a [[verbal#connotation]]

you don't have the [[money]] to afford it **yet**. how can you get to the point where you do have the [[money]] to afford it? &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=362>
