# Can't

**see** [[steer over drift]], [[luck]]

_can't_ is a very dangerous word. it represents the belief that there exists some mystical external force preventing you from doing something. however, more often than not, reflecting on what that external force actually is will reveal that you can still be in control of the situation.

**aka** _I don't deem this important enough to make [[time]] for_

## I can't afford it

**aka** _I'm indifferent to being powerless when it comes to my [[wealth]]_

## That won't work

**aka** _I don't know how to make it work_

you don't have the [[knowledge]] to make it work **yet**. and that doesn't mean other people don't have that [[knowledge]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/wp7Lz1svVro?t=12795>
