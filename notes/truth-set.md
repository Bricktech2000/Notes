# Truth Set

see [[math-notation]], [[set]], [[predicate]]

> **definition**: the _truth set_ of a [[predicate]] is the set of all possible values making the [[predicate]] a true [[logic-statement]]. $x \rightarrow P\ x$, where $P\ x$ is a [[predicate]] and $x$ is a value of the domain of the [[predicate]]

> **note**: in my [[math-notation]], as [[set]]s are [[predicate]]s, a [[predicate]] is its own [[truth-set]]: $x \rightarrow P\ x \equiv P$
