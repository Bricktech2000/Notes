# Gross Domestic Product

> **AKA** GDP

**see** [[economy]], [[productivity]], [[math notation]], [[conventional math notation]]

A country’s GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of [[time]]. it is thought to be the best measure of a society’s economic well-being, and is the most closely watched [[economics]] statistic

the GPD measures both income and expenditure at once (which works since they are equal, see [[economy]] #think)

the GPD includes:

- all items produced in the economy and sold legally in the markets
- the market value of the housing services provided by the economy’s stock of housing
- both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services (haircuts, housecleaning, dentist visits) (see [[goods and services]])
- only [[goods and services]] that are currently produced (for instance, buying a used car would not count towards a country’s GDP)
- only [[goods and services]] within the geographic area of a country (not the citizenship of workers or owners, for instance)

> **note** some products are excluded due to a difficult measurement

the GDP measures all items above within a specific [[time]] interval, usually one year or one quarter

**cons**

GDP has some disadvantages. here are a examples of items contributing to well-being that are left out of GDP:

- leisure as a whole
- activities that take place outside the markets
- the quality of the environment and environmental depletion
- the distribution of income

## Real VS Nominal

_real GDP vs nominal GDP_

if total spending rises from one year to the next, one of two things must be true

- the [[economy]] is producing a larger amount of [[goods and services]]
- [[goods and services]] are being sold at higher prices

in [[economics]], we want to separate these two effects using the **Real GDP**

**definition** _Nominal GDP_ is the production of [[goods and services]] valued at **current prices**

**definition** _Real GDP_ is the production of [[goods and services]] valued at **constant prices** (adjusted for [[inflation]], which is a better measure of economic well-being)

## GDP Deflator

**see** [[conventional math notation]]

**definition** the _GDP Deflator_ is a measure of the price level as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP

GDP Deflator = Nominal GDP / Real GDP

the GDP Deflator can be used to calculate [[inflation]] rates

# Computing GDP

## Expenditure approach

**see** [[conventional math notation]]

_calculating the GDP using the Expenditure approach_

> The GDP is the total of all value added created in an economy. The value added means the value of goods and services that have been produced minus the value of the goods and services needed to produce them, the so called intermediate consumption. &mdash; Zoom Chat

GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports

**definition** _Consumption_ is spending by households on good and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing

**definition** _Investment_ is spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including household purchases of new housing

**definition** _Government Spending_ is spending on [[goods and services]] by local, territorial, provincial, and federal governments

**definition** _Net Exports_ is the value of a nation’s exports minus the value of its imports. **AKA** Trade Balance
