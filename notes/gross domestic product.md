# Gross Domestic Product

**aka** _GDP_

**see** [[economy]], [[math notation]]

A country's GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of [[time]]. it is thought to be the best measure of a society's economic well-being, and is the most closely watched [[economics]] statistic

## real GDP vs nominal GDP

if total spending rises from one year to the next, one of two things must be true:

- the [[economy]] is producing a larger amount of [[goods and services]]
- [[goods and services]] are being sold at higher prices

in [[economics]], to separate these two effects, we use two different measures of GDP:

**definition** the _nominal GDP_ is the production of [[goods and services]] valued at **current prices**

**definition** the _real GDP_ is the production of [[goods and services]] valued at **constant prices**

real GDP it is adjusted for [[inflation]], which makes it a better measure of economic well-being
