# Minimalism

_mindfulness, intentionality, and the pursuit of value_

most people chase a minimalist lifestyle. I just realized [[minimalism]] isn't an [[aspiration]] of mine; it is my diagnosis

similarly to the [[encapsulation]] of mutability in [[functional-programming]], I often find myself encapsulating clutter

quality is very important to me, see [[price-value-sigmoid]]. most of my purchases are intentional, have a clear use and are meant to last a long time. cheap low-quality purchases feel like such a waste in my eyes

> **examples** _cheap low-quality purchases_ low-quality clothes (fast fashion), takeout food, cheap electronics and tools, and so on

other practices of mine include:

- disabling any redundant notifications on my phone
- getting rid of any unnecessary items in my home
