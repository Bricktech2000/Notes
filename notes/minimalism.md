# Minimalism

_mindfulness, [[intention]]ality, and the pursuit of value_

most people chase a minimalist lifestyle. I just realized [[minimalism]] isn't an [[aspiration]] of mine; it is my diagnosis

it seems to be that _frugal_ people are in fact just [[finance]]ial minimalists &mdash; <https://youtu.be/QVbKbyrBMQg>

> **example** _ways in which I am a minimalist_
>
> similarly to the [[encapsulation]] of mutability in [[functional programming]], I often find myself encapsulating clutter
>
> > [containers] create a barrier that can stop clutter from spreading to other areas and corrals it to a single location &mdash; <https://youtu.be/rUnpOplJulM?t=408>
>
> quality is very important to me, see [[price-value sigmoid]]. most of my purchases are [[intention]]al, have a clear use and are meant to last a long time. cheap low-quality purchases feel like such a waste in my eyes
>
> > **examples** _cheap low-quality purchases_ low-quality clothes (fast fashion), takeout food, cheap electronics and tools, and so on
>
> other practices of mine include:
>
> - disabling any redundant notifications on my phone
> - getting rid of any unnecessary items in my home
