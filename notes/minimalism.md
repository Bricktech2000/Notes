# Minimalism

_mindfulness, [[intention]]ality, and the pursuit of value_

many people chase a minimalist lifestyle. I just realized [[minimalism]] isn't an [[aspiration]] of mine; it is my diagnosis

it seems to be that _frugal_ people are in fact just [[finance]]ial minimalists &mdash; <https://youtu.be/QVbKbyrBMQg>

> **example** _ways in which I am a minimalist_
>
> similarly to the encapsulation of mutability in [[functional programming]], I often find myself encapsulating clutter. _[containers] create a barrier that can stop clutter from spreading to other areas and corrals it to a single location_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/rUnpOplJulM?t=408>
>
> quality is very important to me, see [[price-value sigmoid]]. most of my purchases are [[intention]]al, have a clear reason to be, and are meant to last a long time. quick low-quality purchases feel like such a waste of [[money]]
>
> > **examples** _low-quality purchases_ fast fashion, takeout food, cheap tools
