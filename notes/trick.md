_a technique aiming to increase the efficiency of a process_

[[trick]]s don't make someone or something smarter or better directly, but can greatly increase efficiency &mdash; <https://youtu.be/I9Gv3IHXxNs?t=68>

> **example**

> **see** [[math notation]]

> computing $9 - \text-4$ mentally can be done more efficiently by computing $9 \mid 4$ instead. this [[trick]] does not make its user smarter or better at arithmetic, but still improves the efficiency of the user's arithmetic
