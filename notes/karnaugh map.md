# Karnaugh Map

**see** [[logic circuit]], [[boolean algebra]]

--- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map>

the takeaways from [[karnaugh map]]s are:

1. if you represent a $2^n$-entry [[truth table]] as an $n$-cube of side length $2$, meat-[[brain]] pattern recognition becomes easier
2. you can stuff two [[boolean]] inputs into one dimension if you order them like `[00, 01, 11, 10]` then glue the $m$-cube into an $m$-torus

tesseracts are squares of squares so they're intuitive. hexeracts are cubes of cubes and they're just about manageable. in your head it's easier with side length $2$ (cubes) but on paper you can use side length $4$ (tori). don't limit yourself to the classic 2x4 and 4x4 [[karnaugh map]]s

**applications**

[[karnaugh map]]s help simplify [[boolean]] expressions to [[disjunctive normal form]] and [[conjunctive normal form]]
