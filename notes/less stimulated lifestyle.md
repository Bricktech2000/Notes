# Less Stimulated Lifestyle

#todo possibly rephrase and merge with ideas from <https://youtu.be/5Gzv61nYVZI>

## problematic activities

- [[social media]] ([[algorithm]]-based feed)
- [[video game]]s (levels & rankings)
- Netflix & YouTube
- junk food & drinks
- sex & masturbation
- gambling
- music
- porn
- alcohol
- drugs

## problems with increased [[dopamine]] levels

instant gratification with no effort

[[brain]] optimizes for high [[dopamine]], low effort

the release of [[dopamine]] is your [[brain]] thinking what you are currently doing is beneficial to you, or when it believes you are about to be rewarded for doing something

the [[brain]] can come to associate boredom with stimuli (when most people are bored, they open up [[social media]]). for this reason, most people have a really hard time [[focus]]ing

advantages of boredom: self-insight, decreases [[dopamine]] base level (and others)

artificial stimulus is stimulus that wrongfully rewards us (think junk food, movies, [[social media]]). in a perfect world, it would have to be eliminated completely.

## half-baked solution

### not a problem

_preferably avoid, but still allowed_

- music, unless it is [[lofi music]] for [[environmental dependency of learning]]
- browsing [[social media]]
- watching TV
- [[video game]]s
- gambling

### with friction

_allowed, but friction imposed_

> **example** _imposing friction_
>
> each hour of use must be preceded by half an hour of "doing nothing"

- YouTube
- Netflix

### prohibited

_entirely prohibited_

- drugs, alcohol, porn, sex, etc.
- junk food
- posting on [[social media]]
- using a phone to kill [[time]]
