# Pi Function

**see** [[math notation]], [[integral]], [[euler's constant]]

**notation** **`PP z`**

**definition** given a **`CC z`** with **`z^re > 0`**,

**`PP z = $ t[z] -- ee[t] | dd t {@@ . 0}`**

> **note** the [[pi function]] is defined for all **`CC z`** such that **`+NN (.z . 1)`** (it is not defined for negative [[integer]]s but is defined for **`0`**).

> _the gamma function then is defined as the analytic continuation of this integral function to a meromorphic function that is holomorphic in the whole complex plane except zero and the negative integers, where the function has simple poles_ &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function>

**theorem** given a **`NN z`**,

**`PP z = 1 | ... z`**
