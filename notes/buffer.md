# Buffer

**see** [[acid and base]]s, [[equilibrium]], [[conventional math notation]]

**definition** A _buffer solution_ is an aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak [[acid]] and its conjugate [[base]], or vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of strong [[acid]] or [[base]] is added to it. &mdash; Wikipedia

## Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

_allows us to use initial [[concentration]]s instead of having to calculate equilibrium [[concentration]]s_

> In chemistry and biochemistry, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to estimate the pH of a buffer solution. The numerical value of the [[acid]] dissociation constant, $K_a$ of the [[acid]] is known or assumed. &mdash; Wikipedia

**definition**

$pH = pK_a + \log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$, where

- $pH$ is the [[acid]]ity of the buffer solution
- $pK_a$ is the negative [[logarithm]] of $K_a$, $-\log K_a$
- $[HA]$ is the [[concentration]] of the [[acid]]
- $[A^-]$ is the [[concentration]] of the conjugate [[base]]
- $\log$ is a base-10 [[logarithm]], $\log_{10}$

> **note** The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be derived from the definition of the [[equilibrium]] constant $K_a$ and the equation of dissociation of the [[buffer]]
