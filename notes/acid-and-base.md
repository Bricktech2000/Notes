# Acid and Base

see [[buffer]], [[equilibrium]], [[classical-math-notation]]

## common [[acid]]s

> when taking oxyanions ([[polyatomic-anion]]s containing oxygen), adding hydrogen in front and dissolving them in water, we create an [[acid-and-base]]

_for [[chm1301-principles-of-chemistry]]_

- HCl (g): hydrogen chloride
- HCl (aq): hydrochloric acid
- HBr (aq): hydrobromic acid
- HClO3 (aq): chloric acid (_ate_ drops the _hydro_)
- HClO2 (aq): chlorous acid (_ite_ becomes _ous_)
- HClO (aq): hypochlorous acid (_hypo...ite_ becomes _hypo...ous)_
- H2SO4 (aq): sulfuric acid
- H2SO3 (aq): sulfurous acid

## Conjugate [[acid-and-base]]s

> In the Brønsted-Lowry definition of [[acid-and-base]]s, a conjugate [[acid]]-[[base]] pair consists of two substances that differ only by the presence of a proton (H⁺). A conjugate [[acid]] is formed when a proton is added to a [[base]], and a conjugate [[base]] is formed when a proton is removed from an [[acid]]. &mdash; Khan Academy

### example

$NH_4^+ + CN^- \Harr NH_3 + HCN$

- $CN^-$ is the conjugate [[base]] of the [[acid]] $HCN$
- $NH_4^+$ is the conjugate [[acid]] of the [[base]] $NH_3$

## pH and concentrations

$pH = -log[H^+]$ and $pOH = -log[OH^-]$, [[concentration]]s in $\frac{mol}{L}$

$pH + pOH = 14$

### Strong [[acid-and-base]]s

_dissociate completely_

$[Acid] = [H^+]$ and $[Base] = [OH^-]$

### Weak [[acid-and-base]]s

_dissociate partially_

to determine $[H^+]$ from $[Acid]$ or $[OH^-]$ from $[Base]$, write down the conjugate equation with the equilibrium arrow

then, use the right [[equilibrium]] constant $K_a$ or $K_b$ to calculate the [[concentration]]s ($K_a$ is used when an [[acid]] is dissociated and $K_b$ when a [[base]] is dissociated)

### relation between $K_a$ and $K_b$ for conjugate species only

see [[equilibrium]]

$K_a = \frac{K_w}{K_b} \therefore K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}$

where $K_a$ and $K_b$ are the [[acid]] and [[base]] dissociation constants, see [[equilibrium]]

where $K_w$ is the dissociation constant of water, $1\times 10^{-14}$, see [[equilibrium]]

### Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

see [[equilibrium]], see [[buffer]]

## Other

### Water

both an [[acid]] and a [[base]], therefore

$H_2O_{(l)} \Harr H^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)}$

$[H^+] = [OH^-] = 1 \times 10^{-7} \frac{mol}{L}$ in water at $25^\cdot C$ (see [[equilibrium]])

### relationship between $pH$ and $pOH$

$pH + pOH = 14$
