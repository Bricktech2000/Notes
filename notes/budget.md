# Budget

[[finance]]ial [[budget]]s are [[goal]]s and not [[system]]s, which makes them way less than ideal, see [[system over goal]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/ewzC_ica4Fw>

when it comes to buying [[goods and services]], I really don't get the point of [[budget]]s. I feel like they artificially limit the potential value of a product, see [[price-value sigmoid]]. setting a [[budget]] as a rough guideline can be useful, but setting a [[budget]] as a hard limit seems pointless to me.
