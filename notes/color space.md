# Color Space

[[color space]]s are often represented visually on [[cie diagram]]s

almost all [[color space]]s are defined in terms of the [[cie 1931#xyz]] [[color space]]

**types**

[[lms]]

[[cie 1931]]

[[linear srgb]]

[[srgb]]

[[cielab]]

[[ycbcr]]

## Linear Color Space

[[mathematics]] in [[color space#linear color space]]s represent the actual physical [[luminous intensity]] of light and are therefore recommended for compositing operations. all linear color spaces are [[linear transformation]]s of each other and of the [[cie 1931]] [[color space]]s

## Gamma-Corrected Color Space

[[mathematics]] in [[color space#gamma-corrected color space]]s do not look accurate. gamma-corrected color spaces are not [[linear transformation]]s of each other or of the [[cie 1931]] [[color space]]s
