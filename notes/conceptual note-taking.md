# Conceptual Note-Taking

when seen through [[adt organization]], [[conceptual note-taking]] consists of a [[graph]] of [[tree]]s coupled with a [[map]] from [[concept]] name to [[concept]] content; a [[graph]] whose edges are [[wikilink]]s and vectices [[concept]]s, each of which is the root of a [[tree]] of [[markdown]] headings. this [[adt organization]] model forms a great balance between the flexibility of [[graph]]s, the structure of [[tree]]s, and the constant lookup [[computational complexity]] of [[map]]s

**tradeoffs**

atomicity allows for the **efficient reorganization** of continually evolving [[knowledge]]

[[conceptual note-taking]] avoids the need for "disciplines", which are, in essence, arbitrary lines that hinder serendipitous discovery

[[conceptual note-taking]] builds a strong, permanent [[knowledge]] base that offers **great support** when [[learning]] new [[concept]]s and serves as a foundation for coming up with **novel ideas**

through some pseudo-[[frequency illusion]], writing a note about a [[concept]] leads to "noticing it everywhere". at times, it feels like true wisdom to **see so clearly** what was once invisible

having to reason about where a [[concept]] fits in leads to a **better understanding** of it and of related ones. refreshing our [[memory]] by going back over related [[concept]]s forms a **basis for [[spaced repetition]]**

[[conceptual note-taking]] has somewhat of a learning curve
