# Span

see [[math-notation]], [[linear-combination]]

the [[set]] of all [[linear-combination]]s of the [[vector]]s $u_0 \dots u_m$ is called the _span_

$u_0 \dots u_m$ is a _spanning [[set]]_ for the resulting [[vector-space]]

$u_0 \dots u_m$ _span_ the resulting [[vector-space]]

### properties

a [[span]]ning [[set]] is always a [[vector-space]], and all [[vector-space]]s can be represented as a spanning [[set]]

### notation

$\operatorname{span} u_0 \dots u_m \dashv \mathbb R^nu \dashv \mathbb Z n$

$Vec$ is the French notation whereas $Span$ is the English notation
