# Span

**see** [[math notation]], [[linear combination]]

**definition**

the [[set]] of all [[linear combination]]s of the [[vector]]s **`u_0 ... u_m`** is called their _span_

**`u_0 ... u_m`** is said to be a _spanning set_ for the resulting [[vector space]]

it is said that **`u_0 ... u_m`** _span_ the resulting [[vector space]]

**notation**

**`"span" {{u ...}}`** where **`u ...`** are the [[vector]]s in the [[set]]

> **note** **`"Vec"`** is the French notation whereas **`"Span"`** is the English notation

**properties**

a [[span]]ning [[set]] is always a [[vector space]], and any [[vector space]] can be represented as a [[span]]ning [[set]]
