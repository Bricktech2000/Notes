# Span

see [[math-notation]], [[linear-combination]]

### definition

the [[set]] of all [[linear-combination]]s of the [[vector]]s $u_0 \dots u_m$ is called their _span_

$u_0 \dots u_m$ is a _spanning set_ for the resulting [[vector-space]]

$u_0 \dots u_m$ _span_ the resulting [[vector-space]]

### properties

a [[span]]ning [[set]] is always a [[vector-space]], and all [[vector-space]]s can be represented as a [[span]]ning [[set]]

### notation

$\operatorname{span} \braket{\braket{u_0 \dots u_m}} \land (\mathbb R^n u_i \dashv \mathbb N i) \land \mathbb N n$

$\operatorname{Vec}$ is the French notation whereas $\operatorname{Span}$ is the English notation
