# Span

**see** [[math notation]], [[linear combination]]

**definition**

the [[set]] of all [[linear combination]]s of the [[vector]]s $u_0 \cdots u_m$ is called their _span_

$u_0 \cdots u_m$ is said to be a _spanning set_ for the resulting [[vector space]]

$u_0 \cdots u_m$ _span_ the resulting [[vector space]]

**notation**

$\operatorname{span} \braket{\braket{u_0 \cdots u_m}} \land (\mathbb R^n u_i \dashv \mathbb N i) \land \mathbb N n$

> **note** $\operatorname{Vec}$ is the French notation whereas $\operatorname{Span}$ is the English notation

**properties**

a [[span]]ning [[set]] is always a [[vector space]], and all [[vector space]]s can be represented as a [[span]]ning [[set]]
