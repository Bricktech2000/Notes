# Delta Invariance

[[delta invariance]] is an interpretation of the idea that "deltas" are _translationally invariant_

> **example** _have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?_ --- George Carlin. this quote is ironic because it describes someone who sits on one side of one delta and on the other side of another delta while both deltas are translationally equivalent

> **example** _Elon Musk comparing the delta from AI to humans to the delta from humans to chimpanzees_ --- <https://youtu.be/zaB_20bkoA4?t=1360>

> **example** _using [[delta invariance]] in a discussion about gender inequalities_ --- <https://youtu.be/Q7MkSpJk5tM?t=1180> and <https://youtu.be/Q7MkSpJk5tM?t=2465>

the way some circumstance makes someone feel is a "delta". it can be easier to empathize with someone not by imagining what it would feel like to be in their shoes, but rather by imagining an environment which would make us feel the way their environment makes them feel --- me

> **examples**
>
> - homosexuality --- someone heterosexual imagining a world in which homosexuality is the norm instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be homosexual
> - [[wealth]] --- someone in the middle class experiencing being surrounded by the poor instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be wealthy
> - [[intelligence]] --- someone of average [[intelligence]] imagining interracting with people of low [[intelligence]] instead of imagining what it would be like to be of high [[intelligence]]

> **example** I go down stairs two by two. to empathize with people who feel uncomfortable doing that, I imagine what it would feel like for me to go down stairs four by four instead of trying to imagine being uncomfortable going down stairs two by two

many opinions and feelings are "deltas" with respect to some baseline. baselines don't drive opinions and feelings---deltas do. this in part explains why people fall down the [[lifestyle inflation]] spiral and why free trails are so effective

> **example**
>
> - unsalting food makes it taste unflavored, but only when you are used to salted food
> - 60Hz displays and 120Hz displays feel the same, until you get used to 120Hz displays
> - cheap coffee doesn't taste very good, but only when you are used to expensive coffee
> - climbing chalk feels unnecessary, until you get used to its performance improvement
