# Delta Invariance

[[delta invariance]] represents the idea that "deltas" are _translationally invariant_

> **example** _have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?_ &mdash; George Carlin. this quote is ironic because it describes someone who sits on one side of one delta and on the other side of another delta while both deltas are translationally equivalent

> **example** _Elon Musk comparing the delta from AI to humans to the delta from humans to chimpanzees_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zaB_20bkoA4?t=1360>

> **example** _using [[delta invariance]] in a discussion about gender inequalities_ &mdash; <https://youtu.be/Q7MkSpJk5tM?t=1180> and <https://youtu.be/Q7MkSpJk5tM?t=2465>

the way a circumstance makes someone feel is a "delta". it can be easier to empathize with someone not by imagining what it would feel like to be in their shoes, but rather by imagining what environment would make us feel the way their environment makes them feel &mdash; me

> **examples**
>
> - homosexuality &mdash; someone heterosexual imagining a world in which homosexuality is the norm instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be homosexual
> - [[wealth]] &mdash; someone in the middle class experiencing being surrounded by the poor instead of trying to imagine what it would be like to be wealthy
> - [[intelligence]] &mdash; someone of average [[intelligence]] imagining interracting with people of low [[intelligence]] instead of imagining what it would be like to be of high [[intelligence]]

> **example** I go down stairs two by two. to empathize with people who feel uncomfortable doing that, I imagine what it would feel like for me to go down stairs four by four instead of trying to imagine being uncomfortable going down stairs two by two
