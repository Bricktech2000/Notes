> explain resolution in FOL

> In the context of **First-Order Logic (FOL)**, **resolution** is a rule of inference used primarily for automated theorem proving. It is a refutation-complete method, meaning that if a set of FOL sentences is unsatisfiable (i.e., logically inconsistent), resolution will eventually derive a contradiction.
>
> Formally, resolution in FOL operates by:
>
> 1. **Clause Normalization**: All sentences are converted into **clausal form**, specifically into **conjunctive normal form (CNF)**, where each formula is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals.
> 2. **Unification**: Since FOL involves variables and quantifiers, **unification** is necessary to make literals syntactically identical before applying the resolution step. Unification finds a substitution that makes two literals identical if possible.
> 3. **Application of the Resolution Rule**: Given two clauses \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \), if \( C_1 \) contains a literal \( L \) and \( C_2 \) contains the complement \( \neg L \) (modulo a unifier \( \theta \)), then the **resolvent** is the disjunction of all other literals in \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) with the substitution \( \theta \) applied:
>    \[
>    \text{Resolvent} = (C_1' \lor C_2')\theta
>    \]
>    where \( C_1' \) and \( C_2' \) are \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) with \( L \) and \( \neg L \) removed, respectively.
> 4. **Derivation of Contradiction**: By successively applying resolution, one attempts to derive the **empty clause** (denoted \( \Box \)), which represents a contradiction.
>
> **Key Properties**:
>
> - **Soundness**: Resolution is logically sound; any clause derived through resolution is a logical consequence of the original clauses.
> - **Completeness (Refutation Completeness)**: If the original set of clauses is unsatisfiable, resolution will eventually derive the empty clause.
>
> **Opinion (clearly labeled)**:  
> In my view, while resolution is theoretically elegant due to its completeness and simplicity, in practice, it suffers from combinatorial explosion. Thus, practical systems often require sophisticated heuristics and optimizations (e.g., ordering strategies, term indexing) to be computationally effective. Nonetheless, it remains foundational to modern automated reasoning systems.

> Step 1: **Clause Normalization** in First-Order Logic (FOL) involves systematically transforming arbitrary FOL formulas into a standardized form suitable for the resolution process, namely **conjunctive normal form (CNF)**. CNF is a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals. A **literal** is either an atomic formula or its negation.

> 1. **Eliminate Implications and Biconditionals**:  
>    All implications \( (A \rightarrow B) \) and biconditionals \( (A \leftrightarrow B) \) are rewritten using only conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations, based on logical equivalences:
>    \[
>    A \rightarrow B \equiv \neg A \lor B
>    \] > \[
>    A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \land B) \lor (\neg A \land \neg B)
>    \]
> 2. **Move Negations Inward (Negation Normal Form)**:  
>    Apply **De Morgan's Laws** and double negation elimination to push negations inward so that they apply directly to atomic formulas only:
>    \[
>    \neg (A \land B) \equiv (\neg A \lor \neg B)
>    \] > \[
>    \neg (A \lor B) \equiv (\neg A \land \neg B)
>    \] > \[
>    \neg \neg A \equiv A
>    \]
> 3. **Standardize Variables Apart**:  
>    Rename bound variables if necessary to ensure that no two quantifiers share the same variable name across different subformulas. This prevents unintended variable capture during subsequent transformations.
> 4. **Move Quantifiers to the Front (Prenex Normal Form)**:  
>    The formula is rewritten so that all quantifiers appear at the front (as a prefix), followed by a quantifier-free matrix. This step uses the logical equivalences:
>    \[
>    (Qx)(A(x) \land B) \equiv (Qx)A(x) \land B \quad \text{if } x \text{ does not appear free in } B
>    \]
>    where \( Q \in \{\forall, \exists\} \).
> 5. **Skolemization**:  
>    Remove existential quantifiers by introducing **Skolem functions** or **Skolem constants**:
>
>    - If \( \exists x \, P(x) \), replace \( x \) with a new constant \( c \) (if no surrounding universal quantifiers).
>    - If \( \forall y \, \exists x \, P(x,y) \), replace \( x \) with a Skolem function \( f(y) \).
>
>    Skolemization preserves satisfiability (i.e., the set of models), but not logical equivalence.
>
> 6. **Drop Universal Quantifiers**:  
>    After Skolemization, all remaining variables are universally quantified. Since resolution assumes all variables are universally quantified, explicit quantifiers can be omitted.
> 7. **Distribute Disjunctions over Conjunctions**:  
>    Finally, apply distribution laws to achieve the conjunction of disjunctions (pure CNF). Specifically:
>    \[
>    A \lor (B \land C) \equiv (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)
>    \]
>
> At the end of these transformations, the formula is a **set of clauses**, where each clause is a finite disjunction of literals, and resolution can be systematically applied.
>
> **Opinion (clearly labeled)**:  
> I regard the Skolemization step as particularly subtle and critical. While often treated algorithmically in automated systems, it involves a non-trivial shift from logical equivalence to preservation of satisfiability only, which is frequently misunderstood even among experienced practitioners.

> why does skolemization not preserve logical equivalence

> Skolemization does **not preserve logical equivalence** because it replaces existential quantifiers with function symbols (or constants) in a way that changes the logical form of the formulaâ€”it eliminates the existential quantifier by introducing a _witness_ whose existence is assumed, rather than derived from the structure of the domain.
>
> ### Formal Reason:
>
> Logical equivalence means that two formulas are true in exactly the same models. However, **Skolemization only preserves satisfiability**, meaning that if the original formula is satisfiable (i.e., has _some_ model), then the Skolemized formula is satisfiable, and vice versa. But the set of models satisfying the original formula may differ from those satisfying the Skolemized version.
>
> The key issue is that:
>
> - The original formula allows **arbitrary witnesses** for the existential quantifier in **each** model.
> - The Skolemized formula introduces a **fixed function or constant** that must serve as the witness **in all models**, which restricts the model class.
>
> ### Example (Not an explanation, just stating the form):
>
> Let \( \forall x \exists y \, P(x, y) \) be a formula.  
> Its Skolemized form is \( \forall x \, P(x, f(x)) \), where \( f \) is a new function symbol.
>
> In the original formula, for each \( x \), _some_ \( y \) must exist such that \( P(x, y) \) holds, possibly a different \( y \) for each model or context.
>
> In the Skolemized version, we assert that there exists a **specific function** \( f \) that provides such a \( y \) for every \( x \). This is a strictly stronger claim: it asserts the **existence of a global choice function**.
>
> Thus, the Skolemized formula may fail in some models where the original formula holds, but it is guaranteed that both are either satisfiable or unsatisfiable.
>
> ### Summary:
>
> - **Preserved**: satisfiability, unsatisfiability.
> - **Not preserved**: logical equivalence, model-theoretic consequences.
>
> Would you like a formal model-theoretic counterexample demonstrating the non-equivalence?
