# Encapsulation

_an [[abstraction]] over implementation details_

[[encapsulation]] is a powerful idea, especially outside of [[object-oriented programming]] and [[computer science]]. temporarily treating an idea or [[concept]] as a black box while understanding its [[interface]] saves tremendous [[time]] and [[energy]]. diving into implementation details is a great way to get lost in the weeds and lose sight of the big picture

> **example** I don't know the nuances between different sorting [[algorithm]]s. what I do know is that sorting is a thing that exists, I know it has a time [[computational complexity]] of roughly **`O (| /.\)`**, and I know that some [[algorithm]]s are probably better suited for some situations than others. one day when I need to shave off a few milliseconds, I can look into sorting [[algorithm]]s properly. until then, I'll be just fine using bult-in `sort` [[function]]s and treating them as black boxes
