# Encapsulation

_metaphorically enclosing something as if in a capsule_

**see** [[generalism]], [[math notation]]

treating an idea or [[concept]] as a black box is okay, so long as you understand its observable behavior. [[encapsulation]] boils down to just-in-case learning [[cue]]s to learn some [[concept]] just-in-time. _it's okay not to know if you know you don't know_

> **example** I don't know the nuances between different sorting [[algorithm]]s. what I do know is that sorting is a thing that exists, I know it has a time [[computational complexity]] of roughly **`O (| /.\)`**, and I know that some [[algorithm]]s are probably better suited for some situations than others. one day when I need to shave off a few milliseconds, I can look into sorting [[algorithm]]s properly. until then, I'll be just fine using bult-in `sort` [[function]]s and treating them as black boxes
