# Conventional Math Notation

see [[math-notation]]

**cons** _fixed in my [[math-notation]]_

- [[set]] builder notation $\lbrace \mid \rbrace$ is just a $\cap$
- $\sqrt{}$ only returns a positive solution
- $\pm$ and $|\ |$ are totally different but do effectively the same thing
- $ab = a \times b$, why multiplication?
- division can be written as long bar but not multiplication
- $4^2$, $\sqrt{4}$, $\log_2 4$ are the same operation with completely different notation
- no conditional equality symbol
- [[matrix]]es and [[vector]]s can be ambiguous
- [[variable]]s are one letter only, but oh well
- why not allow fully 2D notation?
- chained inequalities don't exist
- $^{-1}$ means both reciprocal and inverse, eg. $sin^{-1}x$ is a reciprocal where it should be an inverse
- [[complex]] numbers are not considered most of the time ($\sqrt{-a}$ and $\ln -a$ are often considered "undefined")
- nested BRACKETS
- [[exponent]]s are right-associative
- [[function]]s can only take one parameter
- indices start at $1$
- $\in$ and [[set]]s
- $a(b)$ is ambiguous: both multiplication and composition
- points and [[vector]]s in $\mathbb R^n$ are two different concepts
- laughable [[summation-and-product-notation]]
