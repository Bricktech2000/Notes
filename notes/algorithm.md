# Algorithm

## examples

[[shors-algorithm]]

[[row-reduction]] through Gaussian Elimination

BFS [[todo]]

DFS [[todo]]

## types

[[recursion]]

[[iteration]]

divide and conquer [[todo]]

## turning [[recursion]] into [[iteration]]

recursion does not exist at the processor level, meaning all recursive algorithms can be implemented using [[iteration]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/jUM_Dpt6yu0?t=571>

### tricks

- using a custom [[stack]] instead of using the hardware [[function]] call [[stack]] (this also prevents [[recursion]] limits from being hit)
- "trying to be clever" (see src)
