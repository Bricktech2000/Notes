# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**see** [[psi function in mat2348]], [[reduce function]]

> **theorem** every [[natural]] greater than **`0`** can be represented as the product of a unique [[multiset]] of [[prime]]s &mdash; me

it follows from the above that **`\y 1 = (( ))`** and therefore **`1 = | (( ))`**

> **example** **`\y 1200 = ((2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5))`** and therefore **`1200 = | ((2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5))`**

> **note** the actual [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] seems to exclude the number **`1`** from the theorem for some strange reason. this might be related to the empty product being hard to grasp for some people or to the fact that it has become a convention to state the theorem in that way. typical math moment. see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic> and <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1549939/fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic-why-greater-than-1> and <https://youtu.be/IQofiPqhJ_s?t=251> and woog Discord DM
