# Characteristic Polynomial

see [[math-notation]]

## definition

the [[characteristic-polynomial]] of a [[matrix]] $A$ is defined as follows:

$\det (A \circ \lambda I) \land \mathbb M^{n, n} A \land \mathbb N n \land \mathbb R \lambda $

## properties

see [[eigenvector-and-eigenvalue]]

the roots of the [[characteristic-polynomial]] of $A$ are [[eigenvalue]]s of $A$
