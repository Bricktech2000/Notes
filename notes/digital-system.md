# Digital System

_digital systems_ and _analog systems_ are children of _electronic systems_

a [[digital-system]] is **not** necessarily [[binary]]

[[digital-system]]s are implemented using [[logic-circuit]]

[[digital-system]]s often store negative [[integer]]s in their radix [[complement]] forms, but can also use [[sign-magnitude-notation]]
