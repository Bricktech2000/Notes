# sRGB

_the universal transfer format, adjusted for [[lightness]] (perceived [[luminance]])_

**see** [[color space]]

math looks entirely wrong in the [[srgb]] [[color space]] because it is adjusted for [[lightness]] through [[gamma correction]]

> **note** generally, when referring to RGB [[color]]s, we are referring to [[color]]s in the [[srgb]] [[color space]]. for example, color pickers and color [[hexadecimal]] codes are in the [[srgb]] [[color space]]
