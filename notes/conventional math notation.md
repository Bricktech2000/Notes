# Conventional Math Notation

**see** [[math notation]]

**tradeoffs**

- [[conventional math notation]] is [[flawed but established]]

- [[set]] builder notation $\lbrace \mid \rbrace$ is just a $\cap$
- $\sqrt{}$ often only returns a positive solution
- $\pm$ and $|\ |$ are totally different but do effectively the same thing
- $ab = a \times b$, $fg(x) = f(g(x))$, $\sin x = \sin(x)$, $xy = x * y$ ([[group#operation]])
- division can be written as long bar, but multiplication cannot
- $4^2$, $\sqrt{4}$, $\log_2 4$ are the same operation with completely different notation
- equalities return [[boolean]]s, except when they do not
- [[matrix]] and [[vector]] literals can be ambiguous
- [[variable]]s are one letter in length, except when they are not
- [[conventional math notation]] is neither $1D$ nor $2D$; it is some sort of a $1.5D$
- $\sin^2 x = (\sin x)^2$ whereas $f^2(x) = f(f(x))$ and $\sin^{-1} x = \arcsin x$
- $\sqrt{-a}$ and $\ln -a$ are often considered "undefined"
- $a < b < c$ might or might not mean $a < b \land b < c$
- [[exponent]]s are right-associative. why?
- indices start at $1$
- $a(b)$ represents both multiplication and application
- [[summation and product notation]] is shameful
- [[matrix]] indices are often written without commas
- $(a, b)$ is a GCD and a tuple and a [[vector]] and an interval
- $\begin{pmatrix} a \\\ b \end{pmatrix}$ is a [[matrix]] and a [[vector]] and a [[set#combination]]
- $f^{(n)}$ is repeated differentiation whereas $f^{n}$ is not
- $f'$ is both a seperate variable name and a [[derivative]]
- $f(1, 2)$ is both $f(1.2)$ and $f(1; 2)$
- $\sqrt{x^2 + 2x + 1}a$ can be mistaken in handwriting
- $4 \equiv 1 \mod 3$ is awful notation
- $\frac{10}{\frac 2 5}$ can be mistaken for $\frac{\frac{10}{2}}{5}$ in handwriting
- $\displaystyle \frac{\bar \Xi}{\Xi}$ is valid notation
- $|x|y|z|$ is both $\operatorname{abs}(x \times \operatorname{abs}(y) \times z)$ and $\operatorname{abs}(x) \times y \times \operatorname{abs}(z)$
- $\mathbb N$ might or might not contain $0$. the same is true for $\mathbb Z^+$
- $2x = 2 \times x$ whereas $2 \frac 2 3 = 2 + \frac 2 3$, and $-1 \frac 1 4$ might or might not equal $-\frac 5 4$
- there exists no symbol for unary division
- there exists no symbol for function application
