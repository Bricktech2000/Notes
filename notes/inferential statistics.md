**properties**

**theorem** _the law of large numbers_ the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed &mdash; Wikipedia

**theorem** _regression to the mean_ there is a tendency for extreme or unusual scores or observations to be followed by more typical scores or observations &mdash; Github Copilot

> **note** beware of the [[gamblers fallacy]] &mdash; results don't "want to even out" over time
