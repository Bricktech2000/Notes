# Russel's Paradox

> **aka** barber paradox

[[russels paradox]] states that it is not possible to construct a [[set]] that contains all sets that are not members of themselves. therefore, it is not possible to construct a [[set]] of all [[set]]s &mdash; <https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?t=1559>

**definition**

_in [[conventional math notation]]_ $S = \lbrace x : x \notin x \rbrace$. Is $S \in S$?

_in my [[math notation]]_ $S\ x = \times\ x\ x$. Is $S\ S$?

after substitution $x \to S$ ([[improved expression evaluation]] notation #todo) we get $S\ S = \times\ S\ S$, which is a [[contradiction]]. therefore, $S$ cannot exist.
