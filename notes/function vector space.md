# Function Vector Space

**see** [[vector space]], [[math notation]], [[function]]

see [[function]] for [[axiom]]s

**definition** $\mathbb F f$ if and only if the [[function]] $f$ is defined on its whole domain

#think if and only if it is a [[set theory]]etical [[function]]?

> **example** let $f\ x = -x$, then $/\mathbb F f$ as $f\ x = \varnothing \dashv x = 0$ (maybe not so fast, see [[improved expression evaluation]])

#think the counterexample above seems to assume the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb R$ even though it seems like it could be $x \rightarrow \mathbb R x \land x \ne 0$
