# Derivative

see [[math-notation]], [[classical-math-notation]]

math notation [[todo]]

## definition

$\frac{df}{dx} = f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$

## notations

### `'` notation

first derivative: $f'(x)$

second derivative: $f''(x)$

third derivative: $f'''(x) = f^{(3)}(x)$

nth derivative: $f^{(n)}(x)$

### Leibniz's Notation

first derivative: $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{df}{dx}$

nth derivative: $\frac{d^n}{dx^n} = \frac{d^nf}{dx^n}$

### in my [[math-notation]]

[[todo]] [[think]]

first derivative: $d\text-dx\ f\ x$

second derivative: $d2\text-dx2\ f\ x$

third derivative: $d3\text-dx3\ f\ x$

nth derivative: $[d]n\text-[dx]2\ f\ x$ [[think]]

## [[derivative-rules]]

## Differentiation

to differentiate a [[function]], apply [[derivative-rules]] recursively

### differentiability

> a [[function]] $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if $d\text-dx\ f\ a$ exists

## Logarithmic Differentiation

_differentiating the logarithm of a [[function]] instead of the [[function]] itself_

### example

## Implicit Differentiation

> Differentiation of an implicit equation (where the dependent variable is not isolated). Works with both [[function]]s and relations that aren't [[function]]s. [[complete]]

### example

$x2 \cdot y2 = 2$

$d\text-dx\ |\ x2 \cdot y2 = d\text-dx\ |\ 2$

$2x \cdot 2y'dy \text- dx = 0$

$dy \text- dx = \circ x \text- y$
