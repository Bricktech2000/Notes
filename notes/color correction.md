# Color Correction

**aka** _color grading_

**see** [[lut]], [[color science]]

[[color correction]] is all about deciding what slice of a wider [[color space]] to bring into a narrower [[color space]] for display

the reason why RAW footage looks desaturated on most displays is that its wide [[color space]] is being "squeezed" (and not sliced) into a narrow [[color space]] for display

HD video and most computer screens use the [[srgb]] [[color space]]. recording in a wide [[color gamut]] such as RAW gives us more information to work with for [[color correction]] before [[compression]] to [[srgb]] for distribution
