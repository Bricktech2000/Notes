# CHM1301 Principles of Chemistry

prof name: Rashmi Venkateswaran

- the prof is there to fill in gaps and help clarify stuff, not to teach what we already know
- prof there asynchronously (email is the best way to reach her, vrashmi@uottawa.ca)
- lab is asynchronous (reserve 3-5 hours in schedule recommended)
- homework deadlines are guidelines
- class is both online and in-person, _we can participate either way_ (CRX C010 according to Brightspace)
