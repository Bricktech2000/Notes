# Zero Knowledge Proof

_a [[proof]] that one knows something without giving any information away about it_

see [[proof]]

## intuitive example

_color blind verifier_

- the prover wants to show the verifier that two balls have different colors without revealing the color of the balls
- the verifier hides the balls behind their back and may or may not switch the balls around
- the verifier reveals the balls and asks the prover to say whether the balls were switched or not

the process above is repeated $k$ times to reduce the probability of "lucky guesses" from an untrustworthy prover

this process proves with high probability that the two balls are different colors without revealing the color of the balls

## uses

Zcash and Monero are examples of [[cryptocurrency]]es that use [[zero-knowledge-proof]]s for transactions
