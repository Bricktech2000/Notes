# Predicate

_a [[function]] that returns a [[boolean]]_

&mdash; <https://youtu.be/aIOMRqiwziM?t=560>

## definitions

### [[computer-science]]

let $f$ be a [[predicate]]. then,

$\mathbb B f\ x \dashv x$

### [[mathematics]]

see [[logic-statement]], [[truth-set]]

> **definition**: in [[discrete-mathematics]], a _predicate_ is a sentence depending on variables which becomes a [[logic-statement]] upon substituting values in the domain. $x = 5$ is a predicate and would become a [[logic-statement]] by substituting $x = 3$. quantifying a [[predicate]] (with $\exists$ or $\forall$) turns it into a [[logic-statement]].

## examples

in Haskell, the library `Data.Char` is full of [[predicate]]s such as `isAlpha` or `isDigit`.

in my [[math-notation]], [[set]]s are [[predicate]]s
