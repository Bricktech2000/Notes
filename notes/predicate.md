# Predicate

_a [[function]] that returns a [[boolean]]_

**see** [[logic statement]], [[math notation]]

**definition** a _predicate_ is a [[function]] with [[boolean]] [[function#range]]

**definition** in [[discrete mathematics]], a _predicate_ is a sentence depending on [[variable]]s which becomes a [[logic statement]] upon substituting values in the domain. $x = 5$ is a predicate and would become a [[logic statement]] by substituting $x = 3$. quantifying a [[predicate]] using [[quantifier]]s turns it into a [[logic statement]].

**examples**

in Haskell, the library `Data.Char` is full of [[predicate]]s such as `isAlpha` or `isDigit`.

in my [[math notation]], [[set]]s are [[predicate]]s

## Truth Set

**see** [[math notation]], [[set]], [[predicate]]

**definition** the _truth set_ of a [[predicate]] is the set of all possible values making the [[predicate]] a true [[logic statement]]. $x \rightarrow P\ x$, where $P\ x$ is a [[predicate]] and $x$ is a value of the domain of the [[predicate]]

> **note** in my [[math notation]], as [[set]]s are [[predicate]]s, a [[predicate]] is its own truth set: $x \rightarrow P\ x =\!= P$
