countersignaling say by using `vi` is neat and all, but if you're wasting your time doing trivial text manipulation or fumbling around trying to remember what file some function is defined in, maybe you should stop playing the damn game and go learn [[vim]] and get yourself a fuzzy finder. <https://www.youtube.com/live/KSs0v2Fmnhc> (pay attention to the comments). at the end of the day a [[signal#countersignal]] is still a [[signal]], and in my eyes people are lowering themselves by several notches already just by engaging in this ping-pong
