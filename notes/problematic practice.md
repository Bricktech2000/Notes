[[comma splice]]s are a [[problematic practice]]

[[rhetorical question]]s are are useful to attract attention, but should not be used to prove a point

using a full term after defining an acronym is a [[problematic practice]]

not citing sources; in [[technical writing]], when information is not referenced, it is taken to be an evidence-based opinion or [[common knowledge]]

improperly using a similar word to the one meant is a [[problematic practice]]

> **examples**
>
> - _science **says** that ... is the **only way** to ..._ science doesn't say anything, and it is unlikely that there is only one way to do something
> - _our cutting-edge editorial software was **designed** to replace an editor._ it is **designed** to, but does it really work?
> - _I will do **whatever it takes** to beat the competition and **make sure we are first on the road**._ but what about safety? the product will likely be rushed
> - _the cases of the **deadly** COVID-19 virus are soaring._ **deadly** makes it seem like the death rate compared to the infection rate is high, but it isn't the case with COVID
> - _the **amount** of people who **continuously** use the word literally [...]_ use _number_ instead of _amount_ and _contitually_ instead of _continuously_
