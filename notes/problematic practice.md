the following are examples of terms that are singular and not plural:

- _The world_
- _The team_ (can be plural in certain circumstances)
- _Everyone_

## not using defined acronyms

after an acronym is defined, the full term should not be used

> Machine learning (ML) &hellip;. ML is also &hellip;.

## switching from indirect to direct questions

the problematic sentence

> Before AIDS was understood, scientists investigated if KS was associated with a new virus and could it be cured? &mdash; Gefen

could be rewritten as

> Before AIDS was understood, scientists investigated whether KS was associated with a new virus and if it could be cured. &mdash; Gefen

## problematic statements

can cause ethical problems, as writing can be used as an instrument of manipulation (intentionally or unintentionally)

### examples

> science **says** that ... is the **only way** to ...

> vaccination is the **only way** to stop COVID

correct version:

> the government's public-health policy is ...

> Our cutting-edge editorial software was **designed** to replace an editor

it is **designed** to, but does it really work?

> I will do **whatever it takes** to beat the competition and **make sure we are first on the road**

but what about safety? the product will likely be rushed

you will not be able to do **whatever it takes**

> The cases of the **deadly** COVID-19 virus are soaring

**deadly** makes it seem like the death rate compared to the infection rate is high, but it isn't the case with COVID

## improper use of words

### _number_ and _amount_, _fewer_ and _less_

### _imply_ and _infer_

_infer_ is used when implicit meaning is made explicit

> Based on what the teacher wrote, I inferred that I got a good grade

### _can_, _could_, _may_

&hellip; between &hellip; and &hellip;

### _if_ and _whether_

> _If_ and _whether_ are often interchangeable, but have distinct uses. For clarity, it is best to use _whether_ in reference to a choice or to alternatives and _if_ when establishing a condition.

for example,

> we're going whether it rains or not

> we will go if it doesn't rain

### _simple_ and _simplistic_

_Simple_ generally has positive connotations whereas _simplistic_ generally has negative connotations.
