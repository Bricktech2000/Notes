# Inflection Point

see [[function]] extrema, [[math-notation]]

## definition

> An inflection point [...] is a point on a smooth plane curve at which the curvature changes sign &mdash; Wikipedia

> a [[function]] $f$ has an **inflection point** at $c$ if it is continuous at $c$ and its concavity changes sign at $c$

> **note**: a [[function]] having its second [[derivative]] equal to zero at $c$ does not imply $c$ is an [[inflection-point]]. as an example, $f\ x = x4$ does not have an [[inflection-point]] at $(x, f\ x) = (0, 0)$
