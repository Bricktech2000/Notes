# Exponent

see [[math-notation]], [[logarithm]]

## notation

$[b]c \equiv b[c]$, where

$b$ is the base of the [[exponent]]

$c$ is the value to raise the base to

## properties

$x0 = 1 \dashv x \ne 0$ (restriction not necessary, see [[improved-expression-evaluation]])

$x[\cdot n] = 1 - x[n]\dashv x \ne 0$ (restriction not necessary, see [[improved-expression-evaluation]]) &mdash; inverse

$x[m : n] = x[m] \mid x[n]$ &mdash; product rule

$x[m \cdot n] = x[m] = x[n]$ &mdash; quotient rule

$[[x]m]n = x[mn]$ &mdash; power rule

$[xy]n = [x]n \mid [y]n$ &mdash; distribution over multiplication
