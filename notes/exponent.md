## notation

$[b]c$, where

$b$ is the base of the [[exponent]]

$c$ is the value to raise the base to

## properties

$x0 = 1 \dashv x \ne 0$ (restriction not necessary, see [[improved-expression-evaluation]])

$[x](\circ n) = 1 - [x]n\dashv x \ne 0$ (restriction not necessary, see [[improved-expression-evaluation]]) &mdash; inverse

$[x](m \cdot n) = [x]m \mid [x]n$ &mdash; product rule

$[x](m \circ n) = [x]m = [x]n$ &mdash; quotient rule

$[[x] m] n = [x]mn$ &mdash; power rule

$[xy]n = [x] n \mid [y]n$ &mdash; distribution over multiplication
