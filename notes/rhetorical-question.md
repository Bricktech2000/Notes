notice the difference between rhetorical questions and open-ended (discussion) questions.

[[rhetorical-question]]s can be problematic in [[technical-writing]], but are not in oral communication. they are useful to attract attention, but should not be used to prove a point.

[[rhetorical-question]]s seem to often be used by emotionally immature individuals to challenge a point &mdash; personal observation

### counterexample

> Should we continue to fly a plane that crashed twice?
