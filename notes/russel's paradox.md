# Russel's Paradox

**aka** _barber paradox_

[[russel's paradox]] states that one cannot construct the [[set]] of all sets that don't contain themselves, and thus one cannot construct the [[set]] of all [[set]]s --- <https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?t=1559>

if $S = \{x : x \notin x\}$, is $S \in S$?. set-builder notation obscures the contradiction but writing the equivalent $x \in S = x \notin x$ reveals it
