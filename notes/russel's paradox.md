# Russel's Paradox

**aka** _barber paradox_

[[russel's paradox]] states that it is not possible to construct a [[set]] that contains all sets that are not members of themselves. therefore, it is not possible to construct a [[set]] of all [[set]]s &mdash; <https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?t=1559>

**definition**

_in [[conventional math notation]]_ $S = \lbrace x : x \notin x \rbrace$. Is $S \in S$?

_in my [[math notation]]_ **`S x = +x x`**. Is **`S S`**?

after substitution **`x -> S`** ([[improved expression evaluation]] notation #todo) we get **`S S = +S S`**, which is a [[contradiction]]. therefore, **`S`** cannot exist.
