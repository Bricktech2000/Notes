# Photoelectric Effect

**definition**

$KE = h \nu \cdot \phi$, where

- $KE$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of the ejected [[electron]] in $J$
- $h \nu$ is the [[energy]] of the incident light
- $\phi$ is the binding [[energy]] or work function (the [[energy]] holding an electron to an atom) in $J/mol_{e^-}$
