# Central Limit Theorem

**theorem** _central limit theorem_ given a sufficiently large [[set]] of sufficiently large [[sample]]s:

- the [[sample]] [[mean]]s are approximately normally distributed, see [[probability distribution#normal distribution]]
- the [[sample]] [[mean]]s have a [[mean]] equal to the [[population]] [[mean]]
- the [[sample]] [[mean]]s have a [[variance]] equal to the [[population]] [[variance]] divided by the [[sample]] size
