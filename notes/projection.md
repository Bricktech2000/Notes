# Projection

**definition** _projection_ is a [[defense mechanism]] characterized by the **unconscious** attribution of one's own unwanted emotions or disowned traits onto others

[[projection]] is a [[displacement]] of attribution --- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(psychology)>

sudden accusations that just don't really make sense are a telltale sign of [[projection]] --- me

> **examples**
>
> - a homophobic homosexual person
> - a cheating partner suspecting the other of infidelity
> - a deceitful person accusing others of dishonesty
