# Price-Value Sigmoid

**see** [[math notation]], [[sigmoid function]], [[diminishing returns]]

the price-to-value relationship for a given product can be represented on the graph of a [[sigmoid function]] &mdash; me

**representation**

![[2022-02-26-01-23-56.png]], where

- horizontal axis &mdash; price on a [[logarithm]]ic scale
- vertical axis &mdash; value on a [[fraction]]al scale

**examples**

> - Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G at **`2`** &mdash; paying twice the money impacts the value less than paying half the money
> - Creality Ender 3 at **`0`** &mdash; paying twice the money impacts the value the same as paying half the money
> - Lenovo Flex 5 2-in-1 at **`.1`** &mdash; paying twice the money impacts the value more than paying half the money
> - Fast fashion at **`.3-2`** &mdash; paying twice the money will yield more than twice the value
> - Branded clothes at **`3-2`** &mdash; paying half the money will yield more than half the value
