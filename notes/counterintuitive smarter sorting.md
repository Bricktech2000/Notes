# Counterintuitive Smarter Sorting

let some items that can be sorted in two different ways, **`A`** and **`B`**, and assume it is more natural to sort the items in way **`A`** (where _natural_ is the first sorting solution that comes to mind). this is ideal when an item with characteristic **`A`** is to be found. however, a lot of the time, when wanting to retrieve an item with both characteristics **`A`** and **`B`**, sorting the items in the less natural way **`B`** would be more efficient

_group items based on hard-to-recognize characteristics, not based on obvious ones_

> **example** the natural way to sort Lego bricks is by **color**. however, it is easier to find a specific **type** and **color** brick if they are sorted by **type** instead. _finding a 2x4 brick in the "gray" section is inconvenient whereas finding a gray brick in the "2x4" section is way easier_

> **example** the natural way to organize a refrigerator is by **type of food**. however, it is easier to find a specific **type of food** that will soon **go bad** if they are sorted by how soon they will **go bad** instead. _finding something that will soon go bad in the "cheese" section is inconvenient whereas finding cheese in the "will soon go bad" section is way easier_
