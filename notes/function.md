# Function

## types of functions

[[boolean-function]]

[[rational-function]]

[[function-vector-space]]

[[piecewise-function]]

## applications

[[curve-sketching]]

[[optimizing-a-function]]

## operations

see [[function-vector-space]], [[vector-space]]

### Zero Function

$O x = 0 \dashv \mathbb R x$

### Function Addition

$(f \cdot g) x = fx \cdot gx$

### Multiplication by a Scalar

$(cf) x = c\ |\ f x$

## [[even-function]]

## [[odd-function]]

## continuity

see [[math-notation]]

> a function is continuous at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a} f\ x = f\ a$. both [[limit]]s must exist.

> a function is continuous **from the left** at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a^-} f\ x = f\ a$. both [[limit]]s must exist

> a function is continuous **from the right** at $a$ when $\lim_{x \to a^+} f\ x = f\ a$. both [[limit]]s must exist

> **theorem**: if $f\ x$ and $g\ x$ are continuous at $a$, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$:
>
> - $f \dot \circ g$
> - $f'g$
> - $c f$ where $c$ is a constant
> - $f \text- g$ if $g\ a \ne 0$

## inverse function

[[todo]] [[think]]

### definition

let $f x$ be a function

if $y = f x \land x = f^- y$, then $f^-$ is the inverse of $f$

### properties

$f f^- x = x$

$f ^- f x = x$

the graph of $y = f^- x$$y = f x$ are symmetric about the line $y = x$
