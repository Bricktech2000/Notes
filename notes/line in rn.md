## Parametric Form

$L = p : td$, or

$L = p : t (p_1 \cdot p_0) \land \mathbb R t$, where

- $p_0$ and $p_1$ are two points on the line
- $p$ is any point on the line (can be thought of as the y-intercept)
- $L$ represents all points on the line (it _is_ the line)

_continue below_

## Symmetric Form

solving the above equation for $t$

$L \cdot p - p_1 \cdot p_0 = t$

using [[vector in rn]]s, we get

$L^x \cdot p^x - p_1^x \cdot p_0^x = L^y \cdot p^y - p_1^y \cdot p_0^y = L^z \cdot p^z - p_1^z \cdot p_0^z$

> **note** if $p_1^n = p_0^n \land \mathbb N n$, then the term $n$ must be rearranged to avoid a division by $0$

## Intersection of Two Lines

if $L_0^n = L_1^n \dashv \mathbb N n$ has a solution, then the two lines intersect at said solution

> **note** as a trick, check to see if the lines are parallel first

## Angle Between Two Lines

**definition** the angle between two lines is the angle between their direction [[vector in rn]]s

## other

**definition**

if $p_1^n \cdot p_0^n = 0 \land \mathbb N n$, then the line is said to _be in a plane_

**definition**

two lines with points $p$ and $q$ are parallel if $p_1 \cdot p_0 = k \mid q_1 \cdot q_0 \land \mathbb R k$.

_two lines are parallel if one of their direction [[vector]]s is a [[scalar]] multiple of the other direction [[vector]]_

## Slope-Intercept Form

$y = mx : b$, where

- $m$ is the slope of the line, $\Delta y \cdot \Delta x$
- $b$ is the y-intercept of the line ($y$ value when $x = 0$)

## Point-Slope Form

$y \cdot y_0 = m \mid x \cdot x_0$, where

- $m$ is the slope of the line, $\Delta y \cdot \Delta x$
- $y \cdot y_0$ is $\Delta y$
- $x \cdot x_0$ is $\Delta x$
