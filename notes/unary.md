**notation** $|||||||\dots$, or with grouping $\cancel{||||}||\dots$, where the number of marks is the [[natural]] to be represented

> **examples** $|$ represents **`1`**, $||||$ represents **`4`**, $||||||||||$ represents **`10`**

> **note** [[unary]] is not considered a [[positional numeral system]]. moreover, it is unclear whether it is appropriate to say that the base of [[unary]] is **`1`** as it behaves differently from all other bases
