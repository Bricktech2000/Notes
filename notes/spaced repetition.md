# Spaced Repetition

_[[learning]] by studying right before forgetting_

**see** [[active recall]], [[interleaving]]

**aka** _spacing_

for [[spaced repetition]] to be most effective, repetitions must be spaced out enough that it requires effort to remember a [[concept]] or a [[fact]]; the more effort required, the more **active** the [[learning]] is. [[spaced repetition]] works because of the fact that our [[memory]] decays at an exponential rate with respect to [[time]], a phenomenon often referred to as the _forgetting [[curve]]_

using _spaced repetition software_ eliminates the guesswork and ensures you are studying at the right intervals
