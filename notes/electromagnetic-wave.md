# Electromagnetic Wave

see [[wavelength]], [[frequency]], [[energy]], [[electron]], [[photon]], [[speed-of-causality]], [[avogadro-constant]], [[specific-heat]], [[planck-constant]], [[density]], [[math-notation]]

a particle of light is called a [[photon]]

_generally, one [[photon]] ejects one [[electron]]_

### other equations

$E_T = E_{photon} \mid \#_\gamma$, where

$E_T$ is the total [[energy]] in the wave, see [[specific-heat]]

$E_{photon}$ is the [[energy]] carried by one [[photon]]

$\#_\gamma$ is the number of [[photon]]s
