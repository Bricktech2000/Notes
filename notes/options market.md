# Options Market

**see** [[math notation]]

## general information

a single option controls 100 shares of the underlying stock

a single option has a lower [[probability]] of making a profit but limit losses to a certain amount

[[options market#trading]] allows for higher leverage than the [[stock market]]

options price rise with high volatility and fall with low volatility

the VIX predicts the volatility of the S&P 500 in the next 30 days. it always overstates its volatility by **`4-100`** --- Felix. therefore, it is more beneficial to be an options seller than an options buyer.

if the _share price_ doesn't reach the _strike price_ of an option before its _expiration_, the option will be worthless. therefore, options with a certain %OTM are more valuable when their _expiration_ further in the future.

## definitions

# Trading

## everything is priced in

when trading on the [[options market]], you are trying to outsmart everyone else in the options market. it is likely that if you think you have an edge, you really don't. unless you successfully outsmart most people in the options market, you will likely make approximately **`0-100`** profit in the long run

## Best Practices

each trade should be around **`1-100 ... 5-100`** of the total portfolio value

**`40-100 ... 50-100`** of the portfolio value should be an asset with high [[liquidity]], such as [[money]]

beta balancing: trades should be neutral to the market direction and not rely on the market going up or down

paper trading is a good way to practice trading

### Short Put

_pay less for a stock_

by selling a put option:

- if the stock price goes down, they can buy the shares at the lower price and earn the premium price
