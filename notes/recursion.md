# Recursion

_a type of [[algorithm]]_

> In computer science, **recursion** is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. &mdash; Wikipedia

## common recursion pattern

1. implement a base case
2. solve one layer of the problem and call recursively
3. restore invariants

> **note**: invariants are used in recursive algorithms that must mutate their parameters to work properly. this is the reason why invariant parameters must be restored before exiting the [[function]]
