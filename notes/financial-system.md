> $S = (Y \cdot \Tau \cdot C) : (\Tau \cdot G)$

> **definition**: _Private Saving_ is the income that households have left after paying for taxes and consumption. $Y \cdot \Tau \cdot C$

> **definition**: _Public Saving_ is the tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending. $\Tau \cdot G$
