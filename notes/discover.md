> **resource** building on strong foundations instead of making things up, with [[rust]] as a case study, by Tristram Oaten aka No Boilerplate --- <https://youtu.be/v6RxJsk8otY>

when building upon strong foundations, [[discover]]y becomes more effective, and [[invent]]ion becomes unnecessary. the [[abstraction]]s resulting from [[discover]]y are deep and flexible whereas those resulting from [[invent]]ion are rigid and brittle

> **example** _syntax sugar_ in [[programming language]]s is [[invent]]ed convenience for the [[discover]]ed

> **example** instead of using [[null]]s for optionals and [[exception]]s for failure cases, [[rust]], thanks to its [[type#algebraic data type]] [[type system]], provides the `Maybe` and `Either` [[monad]]s as library features, in the form of `std::option::Option` and `std::result::Result` --- me and <https://youtu.be/v6RxJsk8otY>
