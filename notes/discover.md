# Discover

**see** [[invent]]

> **resource** building on strong foundations instead of making things up, with [[rust]] as a case study &mdash; <https://youtu.be/v6RxJsk8otY>

when building on strong foundations, [[discover]]ing becomes more effective, and [[invent]]ing becomes unnecessary. the [[abstraction]]s resulting from [[discover]]y are deep and flexible whereas that resulting from [[invent]]ion are rigid and brittle

syntax sugar in [[programming language]]s is [[invent]]ed convenience for the [[discover]]ed. this is why the phrase _it's just syntax sugar for ..._ generally has a positive connotation

> **examples**
>
> - instead of [[invent]]ing [[null]], [[rust]] [[discover]]ed it through [[type#sum type]]s, resulting in `Option`
> - instead of [[invent]]ing an [[exception]] system, [[rust]] [[discover]]ed it through [[type#sum type]]s, resulting in `Result`
> - instead of [[invent]]ing a `free` function, [[rust]] [[discover]]ed it using its move semantics, resulting in `std::mem::drop`
> - instead of [[invent]]ing a `copy` function, [[rust]] [[discover]]ed it using its copy semantics, resulting in `std::mem::copy`
