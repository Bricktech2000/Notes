# Invest

the human [[brain]] evolved in an immediate return environement, which is optimal for survival. in fact, in humans, the largest part of the [[cerebral cortex]], the neocortex, responsible for higher functions, has not changed in size for over $200000$ years. in contrast, modern society is a predominantly delayed return environment, where most choices have long-term consequences &mdash; <https://youtu.be/zUm3fKk00J8?t=17107>. this is why it is very [[difficult]] to [[invest]] [[time]], [[energy]] and [[money]] in the present for long-term rewards. see [[habit]]

moreover, many [[invest]]ments exhibit [[exponential growth]], which is unintuitive for humans. see [[exponential growth]]
