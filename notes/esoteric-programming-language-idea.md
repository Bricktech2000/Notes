# Esoteric Programming Language Idea

see [[programming-language]]

inspired by [[conventional-math-notation]], where [[operator]]s like to change what they return based on what surrounds them

## Initiators

- whether a comment is present in a [[function]]
- number of characters in a line

## Operations

- `+` but sometimes `-`
- `if` and `while`
- `&&` or `true`
- `||` or `2`
- `=` or `==`
