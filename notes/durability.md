# Durability

--- me and <https://youtu.be/qqUgl6pFx8Q?t=1139>

**see** [[encapsulation]], [[generalism]]

[[fact]]s and [[concept]]s lie on a spectrum of [[durability]]. _durable_ ideas are (transitively) underpinned primarily by fundamental aspects of our world. _transient_ ideas, on the other hand, are not---they're artificial.

when [[learning]], it's important to keep [[durability]] in mind. [[learning]] is an [[invest]]ment; the more artificial the [[concept]], the more risky the [[invest]]ment. it's worth noting that artificiality is not, on its own, a deal breaker: I've devoted an ungodly amount of [[time]] toward mastering [[vim]], but I estimate that present efficiency gains make up for the future risk posed by [[vim]] or text editing becoming obsolete

also watch out for "neomania". before jumping ship, catch yourself, take a deep breath, and assess [[durability]]. after all, _la mode, c'est ce qui se démode_ "the trendy is that which goes out of trend" --- Jean Cocteau --- 200 répliques --- Hélène Drouard

> **note** at times I don't enjoy problem solving, and I've been noticing that often it happens when the problem I'm working on is artificial. though I'm not sure if the converse holds
