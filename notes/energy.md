# Energy

**see** [[math notation]], [[international system of units]]

## Kinetic Energy

**definition**

**`E_K = mv2 -- 2`**, where

- **`E_K`** is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- **`m`** is the [[mass]] of the body
- **`v`** is the change in [[velocity]] the body can experience

> **proof**
>
> [[energy]] is [[force]] multiplied by [[distance]]. given **`F = ma`**,
>
> **`E_K = $ ma | dd x = $ m | dd v -- dd t | dd x = $ mv | dd v = mv2 -- 2`**

**definition**

**`E_K = Iww2 -- 2`**, where

- **`E_K`** is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- **`I`** is the moment of inertia of the body
- **`ww`** is the change in [[angular velocity]] the body can experience

> **proof**
>
> when integrating over [[mass]], [[velocity]] is radius multiplied by [[angular velocity]]:
>
> **`E = mv2 -- 2 = $ v2 -- 2 | dd m = $ [rww]2 -- 2 | dd m = ww2 -- 2 | $ r2 | dd m = Iww2 -- 2`**

**definition**

**`Q = mcDDT`**, where

- **`Q`** is the potential [[energy]] stored in the form of heat, see [[electromagnetic wave]]
- **`m`** is the [[mass]] of the body
- **`c`** is the specific heat of the body
- **`DDT`** is the change in [[temperature]] of the body

## Potential Energy

**definition**

**`E_P = mgh`**, where

- **`E_P`** is the potential [[energy]] of a body
- **`m`** is the [[mass]] of the body
- **`g`** is the [[acceleration]] of the gravitational field the body is subject to
- **`h`** is the [[distance]] the body can travel
