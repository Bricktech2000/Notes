# Energy

see [[math-notation]], [[international-system-of-units]]

## Kinetic Energy

$E_{K\ \text{trans}} = mv2 - 2$, where

$E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body

$m$ is the [[mass]] of the body

$v$ is the change in [[velocity]] the body can experience

$E_{K\ \text{rot}} = I\omega2 - 2$, where

$E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body

$I$ is the moment of inertia of the body

$\omega$ is the change in [[angular-velocity]] the body can experience

## Potential Energy

$E_P = mgh$, where

$E_P$ is the potential [[energy]] of a body

$m$ is the [[mass]] of the body

$g$ is the [[acceleration]] of the gravitational field the body is subject to

$h$ is the [[distance]] the body can travel
