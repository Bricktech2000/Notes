# Energy

see [[math-notation]], [[international-system-of-units]]

## Kinetic Energy

**definition**

$E_{K\ \text{trans}} = mv2 - 2$, where

- $E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $v$ is the change in [[velocity]] the body can experience

**definition**

$E_{K\ \text{rot}} = I\omega2 - 2$, where

- $E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body
- $\omega$ is the change in [[angular-velocity]] the body can experience

## Potential Energy

**definition**

$E_P = mgh$, where

- $E_P$ is the potential [[energy]] of a body
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $g$ is the [[acceleration]] of the gravitational field the body is subject to
- $h$ is the [[distance]] the body can travel
