# Energy

**see** [[math notation]], [[international system of units]]

## Kinetic Energy

**definition**

$E_{K\ \text{trans}} = mv2 - 2$, where

- $E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $v$ is the change in [[velocity]] the body can experience

**definition**

$E_{K\ \text{rot}} = I\omega2 - 2$, where

- $E_K$ is the kinetic [[energy]] of a body
- $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body
- $\omega$ is the change in [[angular velocity]] the body can experience

**definition**

$Q = mc\Delta T$, where

- $Q$ is the potential [[energy]] stored in the form of heat, see [[electromagnetic wave]]
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $c$ is the specific heat of the body
- $\Delta T$ is the change in [[temperature]] of the body

**constants**

$c_{H_2O} = 4.184 \shortmid \text{J} \text- \text{g} ^\circ \text{C}$

## Potential Energy

**definition**

$E_P = mgh$, where

- $E_P$ is the potential [[energy]] of a body
- $m$ is the [[mass]] of the body
- $g$ is the [[acceleration]] of the gravitational field the body is subject to
- $h$ is the [[distance]] the body can travel
