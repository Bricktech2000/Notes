## Operation

**see** [[math notation]], [[algebraic structure]]

**definition** a [[semigroup]] is a finite or infinite [[set]] of elements equipped with a closed associative binary operation &mdash; Wikipedia and me

**definition**

let a binary [[operator]] **`{:}`** on a [[set]] **`G_*`**. for them to form a [[semigroup]], the following [[axiom]]s must be satisfied for all **`G_*  a /\ G_*  b /\ G_*  c`**:

_associativity_ **`(a : b) : c = a : (b : c)`**

_closure_ **`G_*  (a : b)`**
