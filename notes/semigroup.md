_a [[monoid]] without necessarily having an identity element_

_a [[group]] without necessarily having an identity element or an inverse_

**see** [[math notation]], [[algebraic structure]]

**definition** a [[semigroup]] is a finite or infinite [[set]] of elements equipped with a closed associative binary operation &mdash; Wikipedia and me

**definition**

let a binary [[operator]] $:$ on a [[set]] $G'$. for them to form a [[semigroup]], the following [[axiom]]s must be satisfied:

_associativity_ $(a : b) : c = a : (b : c) \dashv G'\ a \land G'\ b \land G'\ c$

_closure_ $G'\ (a : b) \dashv G'\ a \land G'\ b$
