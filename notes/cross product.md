# Cross Product

**see** [[math notation]], [[determinant]], [[vector]]

> **note** the [[cross product]] is only defined for [[vector in rn]]3

_results in a [[vector]] of [[vector in rn#magnitude]] ([[area]] of the parallelogram formed by the two [[vector]]s) and of orientation (perpendicular to the [[plane#plane in r3]] formed by the two [[vector]]s)_ â€” 3B1B

**definition**

**see** [[determinant]]

**`||a "cross" b|| = "det" []a & || & b[]`** #think looks like the [[determinant]] of a non-square [[matrix]]

**`a "cross" b = "det" []B & || & a & || & b[]`**, where

**`B`** is the basis [[vector]], i.e. **`[](1, 0, 0, ...) && (0, 1, 0, ...) && ...[]`**

> **`[]a_1 && a_2 && a_3 [] "cross" []b_1 && b_2 && b_3 [] = []a_2 b_3 . b_2 a_3 && a_3 b_1 . b_3 a_1 && a_1 b_2 . b_1 a_2 []`**

**properties**

_not commutative_ **`a "cross" b = .b "cross" a`**

_orthogonal to both [[vector]]s_ **`:(u "cross" v) v = 0`** and **`:(u "cross" v) v = 0`**, see [[dot product]]

_distributivity over addition_ **`a "cross" b : c = (a "cross" b) : (a "cross" c)`**

_distributivity over addition_ **`b : c "cross" a = (b "cross" a) : (c "cross" a)`**

_associativity with [[scalar]] multiplication_ **`k | (a "cross" b) = ka "cross" b = a "cross" kb`** (think of this intuitively)

**applications**

**`||u "cross" v||`** is the [[area]] of the parallelogram with sides **`u`** and **`v`**

can be used to find a [[vector in rn]] perpendicular to a [[plane]] or to two other [[vector in rn]]s
