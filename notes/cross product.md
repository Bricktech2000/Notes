# Cross Product

**see** [[math notation]], [[determinant]], [[vector]]

> **note** the [[cross product]] is only defined for [[euclidean vector]]s in **`RR^3`**

_results in a [[euclidean vector]] of [[euclidean vector#magnitude]] ([[area]] of the parallelogram formed by the two [[vector]]s) and of [[euclidean vector#angle]] (perpendicular to the [[plane]] formed by the two [[vector]]s)_ --- 3B1B

**definition**, see #magic

**`a "cross" b = []a^1 b^2 .. a^2 b^1 && a^2 b^0 .. a^0 b^2 && a^0 b^1 .. a^1 b^0 []`**

**definition**

**`:(a "cross" b)a = :(a "cross" b)b = 0`** and **`\:a2/ \:b2/ "sin" aa = \:(a "cross" b)2/`** where **`aa`** is the [[euclidean vector#angle]] between **`a`** and **`b`**

**properties**

_not commutative_ **`a "cross" b = ..b "cross" a`**

_orthogonal to both [[vector]]s_ **`:(u "cross" v)v = 0`** and **`:(u "cross" v)v = 0`**, see [[dot product]]

_distributivity over addition_ **`a "cross" b : c = (a "cross" b) : (a "cross" c)`**

_distributivity over addition_ **`b : c "cross" a = (b "cross" a) : (c "cross" a)`**

_associativity with [[scalar]] multiplication_ **`k | (a "cross" b) = ka "cross" b = a "cross" kb`** (think of this intuitively)

**applications**

**`"abs" (u "cross" v)`** is the [[area]] of the parallelogram with sides **`u`** and **`v`**

can be used to find a [[euclidean vector]] perpendicular to a [[plane]] or to two other [[euclidean vector]]s
