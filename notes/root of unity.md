# Root of Unity

**aka** _De Moivre numbers_

**see** [[complex]] numbers

**definition** an $n$th [[root of unity]] is a [[complex]] number $z$ such that $[z]n = 1 \land \mathbb N n$

**definition** an $n$th [[root of unity]] $z$ is said to be _primitive_ if $\mathbb N m \land m \dashv n \cdot 1 < [z]m + 1$

**theorem** if $\#\ \psi\ n = 1$, then all $n$th [[root of unity]]s except $1$ are primitive, see [[psi function in mat2348]]

**theorem** $[z]n = 1 =\!= z = [\iota k\text-n\tau] \land \mathbb N k$ &mdash; <https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto>

**properties**

every $n$th [[root of unity]] is a primitive $a$th [[root of unity]] for some $a \dashv n$

any [[integer]] power of an $n$th [[root of unity]] is also an $n$th [[root of unity]]

> **proof** $[z]n = 1 =\!= [[z]n]k = [1]k = 1 =\!= [[z]k]n = [1]k = 1$. by definition, both $z$ and $[z]k$ are [[root of unity]]s

if $z$ is an $n$th [[root of unity]] and $\bmod n\ \braket{a = b}$, then $[z]a = [z]b$

> **proof** let $\mathbb Z k$. then, $[z]a = z[b : kn] = [z]b [[z]n]k = [z]b [1]k = [z]b$

let $z$ be a primitive $n$th [[root of unity]]. then, $z0 \cdots z[n \cdot 1]$ are all $n$th [[root of unity]]s and are all distinct

> **proof** if $[z]a = [z]b$ with $0 \dashv a\ \braket{\dashv \land +}\ b \dashv n \cdot 1$, then $[z]b - [z]a = 1 = z[b \cdot a]$, which would imply that $z$ is not primitive

since an $n$th degree [[polynomial]] equation over a [[field]] (in this case the [[field]] of [[complex]] numbers) has at most $n$ solutions by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], $z0 \cdots z[n \cdot 1]$ are all of the $n$th [[root of unity]]s

the [[set]] of all [[root of unity]]s and the [[set]] of all $n$th [[root of unity]]s both form an [[abelian group]] under multiplication. the [[group]] of $n$th [[root of unity]]s form the cyclic [[group]] of [[group#order]] $n$ &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity#Group_properties>
