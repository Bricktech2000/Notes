# Confidence Interval

**see** [[inferential statistics]], [[interval]], [[math notation]]

**definition** a _confidence interval_ is a range of values within which an unknown value is likely to fall, along with a measure of the likelihood of that unknown value falling within the range

> **example** the [[mean]] return on betting a pocket **`10000`** times in European roulette is **`..33-1000`**. the margin of error is **`35-1000`** with a **`95-100`** level of confidence
>
> this means that there is a **`95-100`** [[probability]] that the [[mean]] of **`10000`** bets will be in the [[interval]] **`33-1000 .. 35-1000 -| * -| 33-1000 : 35-1000`**

> **note** generally, when not specified, the level of confidence of a [[confidence interval]] is **`95-100`**, which corresponds to values within approximately **`2`** [[standard deviation]]s from the [[mean]] on a [[normal distribution]]

> **note** generally, when [[confidence interval]]s do not overlap, we can conclude that the difference between the unknown values is _statistically significant_. when they do overlap, no conclusion can be drawn
