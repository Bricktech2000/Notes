# Confidence Interval

**see** [[inferential statistics]], [[math notation]]

**definition** a _confidence interval_ is a range of values within which an unknown value is likely to fall, along with a measure of the likelihood of that unknown value falling within the range

> **example** the [[mean]] return on betting a pocket $10000$ times in European roulette is $\cdot 33\text-1000$. the margin of error is $\because 35\text-1000$ with a $95\text-100$ level of confidence
>
> this means that there is a $95\text-100$ chance that the [[mean]] of $10000$ bets will be in the interval $x \rightarrow (33\text-1000 \cdot 35\text-1000 < x < 33\text-1000 : 35\text-1000)$

> **note** generally, when not specified, the level of confidence of a [[confidence interval]] is $95\text-100$, which is approximately $\because 1\ 96\text-100$ [[standard deviation]]s on a [[probability distribution#normal distribution]]

> **note** generally, when [[confidence interval]]s do not overlap, we can conclude that the difference between the unknown values is _statistically significant_. when they do overlap, no conclusion can be drawn
