# Confidence Interval

**see** [[inferential statistics]]

**definition** a _confidence interval_ is a range of values within which an unknown value is likely to fall, along with a measure of the likelihood of that value falling within the range

> **example** the mean return on betting a pocket $10000$ times in European roulette is $\cdot 0.033$. the margin of error is $\because 0.035$ with a $0.95$ level of confidence
>
> this means that there is a $0.95$ chance that the mean of $10000$ bets will be in the interval $x \rightarrow (0.033 \cdot 0.035 < x < 0.033 : 0.035)$

> **note** generally, when not specified, the level of confidence of a [[confidence interval]] is $0.95$, which is approximately $\because 1.96$ [[standard deviation]]s on a [[probability distribution#normal distribution]]

> **note** generally, when [[confidence interval]]s do not overlap, the difference between the [[population]] [[mean]]s is _statistically significant_
