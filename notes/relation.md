## definition

a _relation_ $\mathcal R$ between two [[set]]s $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the [[cartesian-product]] of both [[set]]s: $\mathcal R\ x \vdash A\ \acute\mid\ B$

$\mathcal R\ x = (A\ \acute\mid\ B)\ x \land P\ x$, where

$\mathcal R$ is a _relation_ between elements of $A$ and $B$

$P$ is a [[predicate]] (another [[set]])
