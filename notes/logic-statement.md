# Logic Statement

see [[boolean-logic]], [[tautology]], [[contradiction]], [[predicate]], [[truth-set]]

> **definition**: in [[discrete-mathematics]], a _logic statement_ or _statement_ is a sentence that is either true or false. $5 < 2$ is a statement but $x = 5$ is not a statement but a [[predicate]].

> **definition**: two mathematical [[logic-statement]]s are said to be _logically equivalent_ if they are... equal. in other words, two [[logic-statement]]s are _logically equivalent_ if they share the same [[truth-table]]
