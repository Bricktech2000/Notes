# Fossilization

**aka** _faux pli_ --- AndrÃ©e-Anne Caron

**see** [[learning]], [[procedural memory]]

**definition** _fossilization_ is the phenomemon where a suboptimal behavior in a learner becomes ingrained and resistant to change

> **note** _fossilization_ is a term from second-language learning that refers specifically to the ingraining of incorrect language forms. I'm borrowing here because it applies more broadly

[[fossilization]] can lead to local minima you can't learn yourself out of. depending on what you're [[learning]], spotting "bad habits" early and correcting them right away so they don't fossilize can be vital

> **examples** _[[learning]]s susceptible to [[fossilization]]_

> - using [[vim]] bindings
> - writing in shorthand
> - playing an instrument
