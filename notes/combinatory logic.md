**see** [[lambda-calculus]], [[combinator]]

> **resource** _Introduction to Combinatory Logic_, beginner friendly and includes a few constructions --- <https://youtu.be/gnrSedVucXs>

**properties**

the [[combinator#s combinator]] and the [[combinator#k combinator]] can be composed to produce [[combinator]]s that are extensionally equal to any [[lambda-calculus]] term. consequently, SK [[combinatory logic]] is [[turing complete]]
