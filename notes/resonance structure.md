# Resonance Structure

**see** [[bond]], [[lewis structure]], [[molecule]]

**definition** equivalent lewis dot structures, such as those of ozone, are called _resonance structures_. the [[position]] of the [[atom]]s is the same in the various [[resonance structure]]s of a compound, but the [[position]] of the [[electron]]s is different. double-headed arrows link the different [[resonance structure]]s of a compound. the double-headed arrow indicates that the actual [[electron]]ic structure is an average of those shown, not that the [[molecule]] oscillates between the two structures --- Chemistry LibreTexts
