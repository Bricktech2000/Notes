# Positional Numeral System

**aka** _positional notation_, _place-value notation_

**see** [[conventional math notation]], [[math notation]], [[number]]

**notation**

**`\w_n`**, where

- **`n`** is the base, represented by a [[natural]]
- **`\w`** is a [[list]] of digits

> **examples**
>
> **`35_10`**

> **`1001_2`**

**tradeoffs**

many of the advantages claimed by the [[international system of units]] could be realized by any consistent [[positional numeral system]] &mdash; <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Positional_notation&oldid=1113494852>

the base of a [[positional numeral system]] is also a [[number]] and therefore must be encoded in some way, which theoretically causes infinite [[recursion]]: $123_{10_{10_{\dots}}}$
