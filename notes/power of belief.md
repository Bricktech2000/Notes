# Power of Belief

**see** [[religion]], [[hypnosis]], [[expectation]]

deceiving the mind is powerful and remarkably simple. its effectiveness stems from one key observation: to the mind, a powerful belief is indistinguishable from reality. [[concept]]s leveraging the [[power of belief]] include [[hypnosis]], homeopathy, prayer and [[religion]], and the placebo and nocebo effects

often overlooked is the insignificance of the level of deception employed to cement a belief. _if a pill makes someone feel better, does it matter whether it was a sugar pill? if [[religion]] drives positive change in someone, does it matter whether God exist?_ I would argue not

I used to understand prayer as a method of offloading problems onto a higher power in the hopes that they resolve themselves, which goes against [[stoicism]]. recognizing the [[power of belief]] changed my mind; whether a higher power exists and whether prayer suffers from [[confirmation bias]] are irrelevant. **faith** is that which makes prayer effective, through the [[power of belief]]
