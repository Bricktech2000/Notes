# Power of Belief

**see** [[religion]], [[hypnosis]], [[expectation]]

deceiving the mind is powerful and remarkably simple. its effectiveness stems from one key observation: to the mind, a powerful belief is indistinguishable from reality. practices that leverage the [[power of belief]] include [[hypnosis]], homeopathy, prayer and [[religion]], and the placebo and nocebo effects

often overlooked is the insignificance of the level of deception employed to cement a belief. _if a pill makes someone feel better, does it matter whether it was a sugar pill? if [[religion]] drives positive change in someone, does it matter whether God exist?_ I would argue not

I used to understand prayer as a method of offloading problems onto a higher power in the hopes that they resolve themselves, which goes against [[stoicism]]. recognizing the [[power of belief]] changed my mind; whether a higher power exists and whether prayer suffers from [[confirmation bias]] are irrelevant. **faith** is that which brings confidence, comfort and hope, and if that's the purpose of prayer, I'm okay with it

_I am a little jealous of [[religion]] right now. because if you have a sense of purpose that you derive from a [[religion]] [...] and you feel that life has meaning and it's worth being here---even if that belief is based on conjecture, or it might even be false---but if you believe that, you will have hope and you might actually live a good life. [...] I'm a little bit jealous of people who can derive meaning in life from something that is unshakeable. if you have a belief that is not justified in any kind of reality and that belief gives you hope, then nobody can shake that. and if that makes you happy, if that gives you a reason to be here, and continue living and waking up every day... I'm jealous of people who can do that_ --- Freya Holm√©r --- <https://youtu.be/-opBifFfsMY?t=48m2s> and <https://youtu.be/-opBifFfsMY?t=1h4m20s>
