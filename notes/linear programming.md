# Linear Programming

_used to optimize a [[function]] through a set of linear constraints_

[[linear programming]] is a technique that can be used to find the extrema of a [[function]] restricted by a set of linear inequalities, see [[linear equation]]

> **example** _a problem that can be solved by [[linear programming]]_
>
> $f\ x\ y = 180x : 200y$
>
> $5x : 4y \le 80$
>
> $10x : 20y \le 200$
>
> $x \ge 0 \land y \ge 0$

## Feasible Region

**definition** the _feasible region_ of a [[linear programming]] problem is the graphical region in which all linear inequalities are satisfied

## computing extrema

> **procedure** _computing the extrema_
>
> **theorem** [[function]] extrema occur at vertices of a concave and bounded feasible region
>
> therefore, to find the [[function]] extrema of a [[linear programming]] problem,
>
> 1. compute the vertices of the feasible region
> 2. evaluate the [[function]] at each vertex
> 3. determine which vertex maximizes or minimizes the [[function]]
