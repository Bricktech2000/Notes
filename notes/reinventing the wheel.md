# Reinventing the Wheel

**aka** _why reinvent the wheel?_

people seem to confuse _[[reinventing the wheel]]_ and _redesigning the [[car]]_, even though they are very different:

- the _wheel_ is elegant and beautiful; it performs its function nearly to perfection. its core principle has remained unchanged for thousands of years
- the _[[car]]_ is an inefficient and complex machine with coundless flaws. it has been iterated upon for decades, and is still far from perfect

most would agree [[reinventing the wheel]] is a waste of [[time]]. yet, by spending [[time]] redesigning the [[car]], one might just invent the bicycle and revolutionize transportation
