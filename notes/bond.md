# Bond

see [[orbital]], [[quantum-numbers]]

> A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. &mdash; Wikipedia

## sizes of bonds

a triple bond is strong than a double bond, which is stronger than a single bond. similarly, a triple bond is shorter than a double bond, which is shorter than a single bond.

## notation

bonds between atoms $A$ and $B$ are represented as follows in a [[lewis-structure]]

1. $A - B$ ($A : B$) &mdash; Single Bond
2. $A = B$ &mdash; Double Bond
3. $A \equiv B$ &mdash; Triple Bond

# Types of Bonds

see [[bond]]

_there are three different main kinds of bonds_

## Ionic Bond

### properties

- between two atoms, one metal and one non-metal
- involves the transfer of electrons: one has gained electrons, one has lost electrons
- 2 opposite charges attract, forming a bond

### substance properties

- results in the formation of ionic solids such as crystals
- very stable, high melting points, boiling points, rigid
- they cleave along a line
- often very soluble in polar solvents such as water

## Metallic Bond

### properties

- between metals
- a surface (sea) of electrons allows for great conductivity
- bonds are very strong

### substance properties

- they tend to deform, be very malleable and ductile
- very high melting and boiling points

## Covalent Bond

### properties

- between non-metals
- involves sharing of electrons
- one bond consists of 2 electrons shared between two atoms, not necessarily equally, see [[electronegativity]]

### substance properties

- a lot more colour
- tend to be brittle
- molecular substances, we could theoretically isolate a single molecule
- generally have reasonably strong intermolecular bonds, but weak intramolecular bonds
- low melting points, low [[density]], low boiling points
