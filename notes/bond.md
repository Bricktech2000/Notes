# Bond

**see** [[orbital]]

**definition** a _chemical bond_ is a lasting attraction between [[atom]]s, ions or [[molecule]]s that enables the formation of chemical compounds &mdash; Wikipedia

a triple [[bond]] is strong than a double [[bond]], which is stronger than a single [[bond]]. similarly, a triple [[bond]] is shorter than a double [[bond]], which is shorter than a single [[bond]].

# Types

**see** [[bond]]

_there are three different main kinds of bonds_

## Ionic Bond

a [[bond]] between one metal and one non-metal, where one [[atom]] gains [[electron]]s and the other loses [[electron]]s. this forms two opposite charges that attract eachother, forming a [[bond]]

**properties**

- result in the formation of ionic solids such as crystals
- very stable, high melting points, boiling points, rigid
- they cleave along a line
- often very soluble in polar solvents such as water

## Metallic Bond

a [[bond]] between metals, where the [[electron]]s are shared between the [[atom]]s. the [[electron]]s form a "sea" around positively charged [[atom]]s, which are held together by electrostatic attraction.

**properties**

- bonds are very strong
- a surface (sea) of [[electron]]s allows for great conductivity
- they tend to deform, be very malleable and ductile
- very high melting and boiling points

## Covalent Bond

a [[bond]] between two non-metals, where pairs of [[electron]]s are shared between the [[atom]]s in a _bonding pair_. this forms a stable balance of attraction and repulsion [[force]]s between the [[atom]]s, forming a [[bond]]

**properties**

- form brittle or soft solids
- do not conduct electricity
- form molecular substances where we could theoretically isolate a single [[molecule]]
- generally have reasonably strong intermolecular [[bond]]s, but weak intramolecular [[bond]]s
- low melting points, low [[density]], low boiling points
