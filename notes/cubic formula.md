# Cubic Formula

**see** [[math notation]], [[quadratic formula]]

**definition**

**`x = \.q-2 . \ q2-4:p3-27// 3 : \.q-2 : \ q2-4:p3-27// 3`** with **`p = c-a . b2-3a2`** and **`q = 2b3-27a3 . bc-3a2 : d-a`**, where

- **`a, b, c, d`** are coefficients in the cubic equation **`ax3 : bx2 : cx : d = 0`**
- **`p, q`** are coefficients in the cubic equation **`x3 : px : q = 0`**
- **`x`** are the solutions to the cubic equation

> **proof** &mdash; <https://youtu.be/N-KXStupwsc>

**definition** above, **`q2-4:p3-27`** is the _discriminant_ of the cubic equation

**properties**

- if **`0 -| q2-4:p3-27 + 0`**, the cubic equation has one [[real]] solutions
- if **`0 = q2-4:p3-27`**, the cubic equation has two [[real]] solutions
- if **`0 |- q2-4:p3-27 + 0`**, the cubic equation has three [[real]] solutions

> **note** if **`p = q = 0`**, **`x = 0`** is the unique solution as it has [[multiplicity]] **`2`**
