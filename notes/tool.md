# Tool

a [[tool]] can be thought of as some [[set]] of edges of a [[dependency graph]]

> **example** using nails is required for building a chair. a hammer is a tool that drives nails; it allows the use of nails for building a chair

## Scope

notice that many [[tool]]s match one of the following _scopes_

0. _[[tool]]_ does something for something
1. _[[tool]]_ does something for everything
2. _[[tool]]_ does everything for something
3. _[[tool]]_ does everything for everything

> **examples**
>
> - a hammer drives nails for everything
> - [[vim]] does text editing for everything
> - Visual Studio does everything for [[c++]] development
> - IntelliJ does everything for [[java]] development
> - VS Code does everything for everything
> - Obsidian does everything for [[conceptual note-taking]]
> - GDB does debugging for everything
> - Unity does everything for [[video game]] development
> - LibreOffice Writer does everything for word processing

[[learning]] to use a [[tool]] is an [[invest]]ment; understanding a [[tool]]'s _scope_ is essential for deciding whether [[invest]]ing in [[learning]] to use it is worth it. type-0 and type-3 [[tool]]s are relatively uncommon. type-1 and type-2 [[tool]]s are common and worth contrasting. skills with type-1 [[tool]]s are generally **transferable**, and type-1 [[tool]]s are **composable** but potentially **less efficient**. conversely, skills with type-2 [[tool]]s are generally **not transferable**, and type-2 [[tool]]s are **specialized** but potentially **more efficient**

> I prefer type-1 [[tool]]s over type-2 [[tool]]s because I highly value composition and transferability; efficiency I make up for through practice and customization

> Obsidian is a type-2 [[tool]] that is great at some things and not so great at others --- <https://youtu.be/nz99I7apNLI>. regardless, from my point of view, none of this matters because most of the features it has (or lacks, for that matter) are solved problems:
>
> - Obsidian has good search---but search is a solved problem; grep and find are great at it
> - Obsidian has great autocomplete---but autocomplete is a solved problem; [[vim]] and VS Code are great at it
> - Obsidian has first-party file syncing---but file syncing is a solved problem; Git and Syncthing are great at it
> - Obsidian has a paid [[markdown]]-to-web service---but [[markdown]]-to-web is a solved problem; mkdocs and hugo are great at it
> - Obsidian lacks support for team collaboration---but team collaboration is a solved problem; Git and GitHub are great at it
> - Obsidian is good at text manipulation---but text manipulation is a solved problem; [[vim]] bindings are great at it
> - Obsidian is phenomenal for linking---but linking is a solved problem; [[markdown]] with [[wikilink]]s are great at it

> **note** type-0 and type-1 tools appear to correspond to the _Write programs that do one thing and do it well._ part of the Unix philosophy
