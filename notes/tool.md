# Tool

a [[tool]] can be defined as a [[set]] of edges in a [[graph]] whose vertices are _"things"_ and edges represent that one "thing" _is required for_ another "thing"

> **example** using nails is required for building a chair. a hammer is a tool that drives nails; it allows the use of nails to build a chair

## Scope

notice that many [[tool]]s match one of the following _scopes_. [[learning]] to use a [[tool]] is an [[invest]]ment; understanding a [[tool]]'s _scope_ is essential for deciding whether [[invest]]ing in [[learning]] to use it is worth it

1. _[[tool]]_ does _X_ for _Y_
2. _[[tool]]_ does _X_ for "everything"
3. _[[tool]]_ does "everything" for _Y_
4. _[[tool]]_ does "everything" for "everything"

> **examples**
>
> - a hammer drives nails for "everything"
> - Vim does text editing for "everything"
> - Visual Studio does "everything" for [[c++]] development
> - IntelliJ does "everything" for [[java]] development
> - VS Code does "everything" for "everything"
> - Obsidian does "everything" for [[conceptual note-taking]]
> - `gdb` does debugging for "everything"
> - Unity does "everything" for [[video game]] development

type-1 and type-4 [[tool]]s are relatively rare. type-2 and type-3 [[tool]]s are common but very different. skills with type-2 tools are transferable, and type-2 tools are composable but potentially less efficient. skills with type-3 tools are often not transferable, and type-3 tools are specialized but potentially more efficient
