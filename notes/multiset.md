# Multiset

see [[math-notation]]

> **definition**: a _multiset_ is an unordered collection of elements that do not have to be unique

> **definition**: _formally in my [[math-notation]]_
>
> a [[multiset]] is a [[set-theory]]etical [[function]] with range at most $\mathbb N$ that takes an element and returns the number of occurrences of that element in the [[multiset]]

> **notation**: $M = ((1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3))$

## Multiplicity

> **definition**: the _multiplicity_ of a member of a [[multiset]] is the number of times it appears in the [[multiset]] &mdash; Wikipedia

> **example**: in the [[polynomial]] $[x \cdot 1]2$, the [[multiplicity]] of the root $1$ is $2$

> **example**: in the prime factorization of $60$, the [[multiplicity]] of the factor $2$ is $2$ and the [[multiplicity]] of the factors $3$ and $5$ is $1$
