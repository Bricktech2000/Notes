# Multiset

see [[math-notation]]

## definition

a _multiset_ is an unordered collection of elements that do not have to be unique

formally, in my [[math-notation]], a [[multiset]] is a [[set-theory]]etical [[function]] with range at most $\mathbb N$ that takes an element and returns the number of occurrences of that element in the [[multiset]]

## Multiplicity

### definition

> **definition**: the _multiplicity_ of a member of a [[multiset]] is the number of times it appears in the [[multiset]] &mdash; Wikipedia

### example

in the [[polynomial]] $[x \cdot 1]2$, the [[multiplicity]] of the root $1$ is $2$

in the prime factorization of $60$, the [[multiplicity]] of the factor $2$ is $2$ and the [[multiplicity]] of the factors $3$ and $5$ is $1$

### notation

in my [[math-notation]], the [[multiplicity]] of an element $e$ in a [[multiset]] $M$ is $M\ e$
