# Significant Figures

see [[math-notation]]

&mdash; <http://cxp.cengage.com/contentservice/assets/owms01h/references/significantfigures/index.html>

## rule

> All digits are significant, except for leading zeros or for zeros that appear after a number without being followed by a decimal point.

### examples

$3.0$ has 2 significant figures

$30$ has 1 significant figure

$30.$ has 2 significant figures

$0.005$ has 1 significant figure

$0.0050$ has 2 significant figures

## operations

assuming a base-10 [[positional-numeral-system]] and base-10 [[logarithm]]s

### addition and subtraction

keep as many significant figures after the last significant digit as the lowest number of of significant figures after the last significant digit in the original numbers

$\ \ \ \ \ \ 530$ (2 significant figures)

$\ : \ 1140.5$ (5 significant figures, offset)

$=1190$ (3 significant figures, trailing digits cut off)

### multiplication and division

_keep as many significant figures as the number with the least number of significant figures_

### [[logarithm]]s

_keep as many significant figures to the right of the decimal point as there are significant figures in the original number_

$\lceil 4.000 \rceil 10$ (4 significant figures)

$= 0.6021$ (4 significant figures on the right of the decimal point)

### anti[[logarithm]]s

_keep the same number of significant figures as the number of significant figures after the decimal point in the original number_

$10[\cdot 2.55]$ (2 significant figures on the right of the decimal point)

$= 2.8 10[\cdot 3]$ (2 significant figures)
