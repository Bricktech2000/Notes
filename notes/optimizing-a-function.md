# Optimizing a Function

see [[extremum]], [[math-notation]]

> Practically, function optimization describes a class of problems for finding the input to a given function that results in the minimum or maximum output from the function. &mdash; machinelearningmastery.com

## method

1. [[calculating-a-derivative]] to find [[extremum]].
2. use second derivative test (see [[extremum]]) to determine type of extremum.
3. use the information above to maximize or minimize the output of the function

## example

maximize $f\ x = 600x \circ 2x2$

1. $d\text-dx\ f\ x = 600 \circ 4x$. therefore, $d\text-dx f\ x = 0$ at $x = 150$
2. $d2\text-dx2 f\ x = \circ 4$, meaning this is a local [[extremum|maximum]]
3. the function is maximized at $x = 150$, $f\ 150 = 45000$
