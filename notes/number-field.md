# Number Field

see [[math-notation]], [[set]], [[number]]

## examples

- the [[set]] of [[real]] numbers
- the [[set]] of [[complex]] numbers
- the [[set]] of [[integer]]s modulo a prime [[number]]

## definition

a [[set]] of numbers with certain properties and two operations defined: addition and multiplication

### [[axiom]]s

&mdash; Encode x Solana Bootcamp

let $a, b, c$ be numbers in a [[number-field]] $\mathbb F$

$a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ &mdash; associativity of addition

$a(bc) = (ab)c$ &mdash; associativity of multiplication

$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ &mdash; commutativity of addition

$ab = ba$ &mdash; commutativity of multiplication

$\mathbb F O \land a \cdot O = a$ &mdash; additive identity

$\mathbb F I \land aI = a$ &mdash; multiplicative identity

$\mathbb F (\circ a) \land a \cdot (\circ a) = O$ &mdash; additive inverse

$\mathbb F (\text-a) \land a(\text-a) = I$ &mdash; multiplicative inverse

$a(b \cdot c) = ab \cdot ac$ &mdash; distributivity of multiplication over addition

## applications

[[number-field]]s are use as _scalars_ in linear algebra

> **note**: in [[mat1341-d-introduction-to-linear-algebra]], the [[number-field]] of [[real]]s was used for all computations. the [[number-field]] of [[complex]] numbers could've also been used instead
