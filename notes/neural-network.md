## training

training a neural network consists of minimizing a [[loss-function]] through [[gradient]] descent. the algorithm that computes this [[gradient]] efficiently is called [[backpropagation]]

## Hello World

the hello world of neural networks is recognizing hand-written digits. the MNIST database contains tens of thousands of labeled hand-written digit images, which can be used for training &mdash; <https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w>

## differences with biology

the activation of neurons in a neural network is continuous whereas the activation of biological neurons is [[binary]]
