# Video Game

the following video is good summary of my view on video games: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7f3JZJHSw&ab_channel=Razbuten>

**tradeoffs**

[[video game]]s are a prime example of [[hijacking brain circuitry]]. they make the primitive [[brain]] circuitry of the player believe they are achieving something, where as they are arguably not. they release a relatively large [[amount of]] [[dopamine]] and make the player go through a large variety of emotions. some games, such as first-person shooters, make the primitive parts of the player's [[brain]] believe that events are happening in the real world, even though they are obviously in a simulated environment

microtransactions in "free" [[video game]] use player [[psychology]] ([[subconscious manipulation]], [[addiction]] strategies, [[material distortion]]) to get them to spend more [[money]] &mdash; <https://youtu.be/keoRX-Lni5s>

video games are _bad [[habit]]s_; they have high short-term reward but low long-term reward, see [[habit]]
