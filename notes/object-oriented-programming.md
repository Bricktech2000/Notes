# Object-Oriented Programming

the goal of [[object-oriented-programming]] is to build objects based on their real-world properties, in contrast to [[functional-programming]] or to procedural programming

see [[object]], [[class]]

## Principles of OOP

&mdash; Google and Grepper

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> every module, [[class]] or [[function]] in a computer program should have responsibility for a single part of that program's functionality

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

> software entities ([[class]]es, modules, [[function]]s, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> objects of a super[[class]] shall be replaceable with objects of its sub[[class]]es without breaking the application

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Clients should not be forced to depend upon [[interface]]s that they do not use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
