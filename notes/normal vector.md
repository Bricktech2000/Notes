# Normal Vector

_a [[euclidean vector]] perpendicular to a [[plane]]_

**notation** **`n`**

> **procedure** _computing a [[normal vector]]_
>
> the [[normal vector]] of a [[plane]] is perpendicular to all its direction vectors. it can therefore be computed by setting the [[dot product]] of the normal vector to every direction vector to zero, and solving for the normal vector
>
> in the case of [[euclidean vector]]s in **`RR^3`**, the [[cross product]] of two [[vector]]s in a [[plane]] will yield a [[normal vector]] to that [[plane]]
