# Wordiness

**definition** _wordiness_ is a measure of the [[density]] of information in a text; high wordiness corresponds to low information density

**definition** a _vague_ word has many different meanings, is open to interpretation

**definition** an _ambiguous_ word has a few distinct different meanings

**definition** a _generic_ word is not specific enough but doesn't cause vagueness

high [[wordiness]] can "cover-up" for a lack of information and analysis --- Gefen. it is to be avoided in [[technical writing]]

[[wordiness]] can manifest in several ways, often through the use of:

- vague, ambiguous, generic words and [[rhetorical question]]s
- _it is [...] who_ and _there is [...] that_ and similar constructions
- _, and this_ and similar constructions
- _in order to_ and _in the process of_ and similar constructions
