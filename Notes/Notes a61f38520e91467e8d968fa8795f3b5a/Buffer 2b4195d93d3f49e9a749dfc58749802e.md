> A buffer solution is an aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it. — Wikipedia

## example

$NH_{3(aq)} + H^+_{aq} \rightarrow NH_{4(aq)}^+$

$NH_{3(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)} \rightarrow NH_{3(aq)} + H_2O_{(aq)}$

## Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

> In chemistry and biochemistry, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to estimate the pH of a buffer solution. The numerical value of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$ of the acid is known or assumed. — Wikipedia
> 

$pH = pK_a + \log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

where

$pH$ is the acidity of the buffer solution

$pK_a$ is the negative logarithm of $K_a$, $-\log K_a$

$[HA]$ is the concentration of the acid

$[A^-]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base

$\log$ is a base-10 logarithm, $\log_{10}$

### note

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be derived from the definition of the [Equilibrium](Equilibrium%20a8f9599f4a064c8b9f37ae20f90835c3.md) constant $K_a$ and the equation of dissociation of the [Buffer]()

$HA + H_2O \Leftrightarrow A^- + H_3O^+$
