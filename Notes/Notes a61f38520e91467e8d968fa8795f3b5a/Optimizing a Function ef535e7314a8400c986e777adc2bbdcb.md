# Optimizing a Function

## example

$f(x) = 600x - 2x^2$

$f'(x) = 600 - 4x$

1. Find critical points
    - [Calculating a Derivative](Calculating%20a%20Derivative%208ee8cca8aa8f46749f2d88c898b8466d.md) to find extremum $f'(x) = 0\ for\ x = 150$
    - use logic to determine type of extremum: local maximum
2. TA decided to stop here because the answers don't match up at the end
