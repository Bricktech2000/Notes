# Optimizing a Function

> Practically, function optimization describes a class of problems for finding the input to a given function that results in the minimum or maximum output from the function. â€” machinelearningmastery.com

## example

$f(x) = 600x - 2x^2$

$f'(x) = 600 - 4x$

1. Find critical points
    - [Calculating a Derivative](Calculating%20a%20Derivative%208ee8cca8aa8f46749f2d88c898b8466d.md) to find [Extremum](Extremum%20b28f7c5907fb47adb037ca90b838c2db.md) $f'(x) = 0\ for\ x = 150$
    - use logic or second derivative test (see [Extremum](Extremum%20b28f7c5907fb47adb037ca90b838c2db.md)) to determine type of extremum. in this case, it is a local maximum
