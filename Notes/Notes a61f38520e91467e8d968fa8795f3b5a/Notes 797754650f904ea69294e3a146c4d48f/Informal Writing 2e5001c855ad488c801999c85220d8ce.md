## common informal writing practices

### capital letters

capital letters are not used at the beginning of sentences. a sentence written entirely in capital letters indicates shouting

### question marks

*indicate the rise of the writerâ€™s tone*

question marks are not required at the end of a question. question marks can be added at the end of non-question sentences

### full stops

*indicate seriousness*

full stops are not used at the end of sentences

### asterisk

*indicates emphasis or a correction*

when used around a word or a group of words, asterisks indicate emphasis. when used at the beginning of another message, an asterisk communicates a correction in the previous message

### sentences

longer sentences are often cut up into multiple shorter messages, and individual sentences are often communicated by sending multiple messages. multiple sentences can also be written one after the other with no punctuation if they can be orally read without a pause.

### comma splices

*indicate two related sentences*

comma splices are valid in informal writing for use between two related sentences. semi colons and dashes are almost never used

### quotation marks

quotation marks are almost never used in informal writing. they should not be used for emphasis
