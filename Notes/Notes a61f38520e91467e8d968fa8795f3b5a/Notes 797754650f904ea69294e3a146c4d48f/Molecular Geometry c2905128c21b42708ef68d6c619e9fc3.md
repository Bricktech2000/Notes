based on the *Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory* (VSEPR), our guiding principle is to keep electron groups as far away from one another as possible.

## Linear

*line*

$180\degree$ between each atom

**shape**: line

## Trigonal Planar

*triangle*

$120\degree$ between each atom

**shape**: trigonal, or bend

## Tetrahedral

*tetrahedron*

$\sim 109.5\degree$ between each atom

**shape**: tetrahedral, trigonal pyramidal or bend

## Trigonal Bipyramidal

*triangular bipyramid, or octahedron with one vertex missing*

$180\degree$ between the two atoms on top of each pyramid

$120\degree$ between atoms in the base of the pyramid

$90\degree$ between atoms in the base and on top of the pyramid

**shape**: trigonal bipyramidal, seesaw, T-shape, line. atoms in the base of the pyramids (equatorial atoms) are replaced before the ones on top of the pyramids (axial atoms)

## Octahedral

*octahedron*

$90\degree$ between each atom

**shape**: square pyramidal, square planar (others possible)
