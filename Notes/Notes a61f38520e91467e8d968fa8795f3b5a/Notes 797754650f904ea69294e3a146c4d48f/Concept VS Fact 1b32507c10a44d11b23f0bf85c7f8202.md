## Fact

*an isolated piece of information related to a concept*

facts can easily get confused, which is the reason why we have reference books and search engines. *if you know the concept, you can quickly look up the fact*. facts can be learned through [Mnemonics](Mnemonics%203ffa4a90028b403287c9bbbff62e561a.md).

### examples

- a date at which an event took place
- the name of a bone in the human body

## Concept

*a piece of information tightly related to multiple other concepts*

generally, they are more important than facts. they can be structured through conceptual [Notes](../../Notes%20a61f38520e91467e8d968fa8795f3b5a.md). once grasped, they stay with you a lifetime. when learning concepts, make sure to understand the difference between [Recollection VS Recognition](Recollection%20VS%20Recognition%20442dc0e29c414a4fb213a89415331897.md).

### examples

- understanding the function of a bone in the human body
- understanding why an event actually took place
