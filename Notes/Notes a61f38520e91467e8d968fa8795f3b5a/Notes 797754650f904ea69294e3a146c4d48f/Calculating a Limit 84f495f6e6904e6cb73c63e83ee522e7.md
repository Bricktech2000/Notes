# Calculating a Limit

see [Classical Math Notation](Classical%20Math%20Notation%20eb53679093ce497baa118d7bfde14d6c.md), [Limit Rules](Limit%20Rules%20c295bd3b2c56490482b7786a01f0cc78.md)

## tricks

- $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ indeterminate form (see [Rational Function](Rational%20Function%207e9aa1c92c1b4d76a8bca5706be9a56b.md))
    - formal method: factor out the highest power in both the numerator and the denominator
    - informal method: look at the highest degree of the numerator and of the denominator
- addition or subtraction of fractions, try to use a common denominator
- subtraction of square roots, try to multiply by the conjugate
