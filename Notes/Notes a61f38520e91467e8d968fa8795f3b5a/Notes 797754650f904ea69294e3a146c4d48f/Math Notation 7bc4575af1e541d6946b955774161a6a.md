# Math Notation

## Problems with Math notation. Yes, there's a list.

- { | } notation is just a ∩
- √ only returns a positive solution
- ± and | | are totally different but do effectively the same thing
- ab = a * b, why multiplication?
- division written as long bar but not multiplication
- 4², √4, log2 are the same operation with completely different notation
- no conditional equality symbol
- matrices and vectors can be ambiguous
- variables are one letter only, but oh well
- why not allow 2D notation?
- chained inequalities don't exist
- ^-1 means both reciprocal and inverse, eg. sin-1(x) is a reciprocal where it should be an inverse
- complex numbers are not considered most of the time (sqrt of negative and log of zero are often "undefined")
- nested BRACKETS
- exponents are right-associative
- functions can only take one parameter
- indices start at 1
- ∈ and sets
- a(b) is ambiguous: both multiplication and composition

$\lim_{x \to 0}\frac x x$

$\frac{\lim_{x \to 0} x}{x}$

## new notation

### notation

$a \cdot b$ is an addition

$a \circ b$ is a subtraction

$a \text- b$ is a division

$a - b$ is a low-precedence division

$ab$ is a high-precedence multiplication

$a ' b$ is a multiplication

$a\ |\ b$ is a low-precedence multiplication

$\braket{a}b$ is $a$ to the power of $b$

$\braket{a}\circ b$ is the $b$th root of $a$

$b \braket{a}$ is the base-$b$ logarithm of $a$

$\N\ a$ checks whether $a$ is part of the set $\N$

$:$ is high-precedence equality

$=$ is "normal" equality

trig identities: $sin$, $asin$, $cos$, $acos$, $tan$, $atan$

### principles

- $=$ **checks** for equality and returns a boolean
- it is implied that an expression on its own has to evaluate to `True`
- sets are functions that return a boolean ($\R(a) = \R\ a$ instead of $a \in \R$)
- $\braket{a} = \braket{a}\circ 2$ returns both positive and negative square roots of $a$
- functions support currying to take multiple arguments

### examples

- quadratic formula: $\circ\ b\cdot \braket{b^2\circ4ac}-2a$
- definition of the set of complex numbers: $\mathbb{C}\ x = x : a\cdot bi \cap \R\ a \cap \R\ b$

### random formulas

$df\text- dx = \lim_{j \to 0} f (x \cdot h) \circ f (x) - h$

$\braket{a \cdot b}2 = a^2 \cdot b^2 \cdot 2ab$

$V = b \cdot B\ |\ h - 2$

$\int_a^b(df\text- dx)\ x\ dx = f\ b \circ f\ a$

$d\text- dx\int_a^x(f\ t)\ dt = f x$

$a^2 \circ b^2 = a \circ b\ |\ a \cdot b$

$a^2 \cdot b^2 = c^2$

$y = \braket{r^2 \circ x^2}$

$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$

$\braket{e}i\pi = \circ\ 1$
