# Math Notation

## Problems with Math notation. Yes, there's a list.

- { | } notation is just a ∩
- √ only returns a positive solution
- ± and | | are totally different but do effectively the same thing
- ab = a * b, why multiplication?
- division written as long bar but not multiplication
- 4², √4, log2 are the same operation with completely different notation
- no conditional equality symbol
- matrices and vectors can be ambiguous
- variables are one letter only, but oh well
- why not allow 2D notation?
- chained inequalities don't exist
- ^-1 means both reciprocal and inverse, eg. sin-1(x) is a reciprocal where it should be an inverse
- complex numbers are not considered most of the time (sqrt of negative and log of zero are often "undefined")
- nested BRACKETS
- exponents are right-associative
- functions can only take one parameter
- indices start at 1
- ∈ and sets
- a(b) is ambiguous: both multiplication and composition
- points and vectors in $\R^n$ are two different concepts

$\lim_{x \to 0}\frac x x$

$\frac{\lim_{x \to 0} x}{x}$

## new notation

### notation

$a \cdot b$ is addition

$a \circ b$ is subtraction

$\dot \circ$ and $\mathring \cdot$ are $\pm$ and $\mp$ respectively

$a \text- b$ is division

$a - b$ is low-precedence division

$ab$ is high-precedence multiplication

$a ' b$ is multiplication

$a\ |\ b$ is low-precedence multiplication

$\braket a b$ is $a$ to the power of $b$

$\braket a \text- b$ is the $b$th root of $a$

$b \braket a$ is the base-$b$ logarithm of $a$

$a\ b$ is shorthand for $\braket a b$ if $b$ is a number

$\N a$ checks whether $a$ is part of the set $\N$

$a = b$ checks whether two expressions are equal

$a : b$ is high-precedence equality check

$a \land b$ is logical and (`and`)

$a \lor b$ is logical or (`or`)

$\neg a$ is logical not (`not`)

$\top$ is logical truth (`true`)

$\bot$ is logical false (`false`)

$a \vdash b$ means *a implies b* or *a is a subset of b* or *b is true for every a*

$a \dashv b$ is the inverse of above

$a \equiv b$ is logical equality check (equivalent to $=$)

$a \to b$ is lambda notation (`(a) => b`)

$\varnothing$ is undefined

trig identities: $sin$, $asin$, $cos$, $acos$, $tan$, $atan$

### principles

- $=$ **checks** for equality and returns a boolean
- it is implied that an expression on its own must evaluate to $\top$(`True`)
- sets are functions that return a boolean ($\R(a) = \R\ a$ instead of $a \in \R$)
- $\braket a = \braket a \text- 2$ returns both positive and negative square roots ($\braket{\braket q2} = q \lor \circ q$)
- $\braket 4 = 2$ is invalid, but $\braket 4 \dashv 2$ is valid
- functions support currying to take multiple arguments

### examples

- quadratic formula: $\circ b \cdot \braket{b2 \circ 4ac} - 2a$
- definition of the set of complex numbers: $\mathbb{C}= x \to x : a\cdot bi \land \R\ a \land \R\ b$
- definition of multiplication of a boolean by a scalar:
    - $\mathbb{B} = b \to b : \top \lor b : \bot$
    - $(ab = b \dashv a \ne 0 \land \mathbb{B}b) \vdash 2\top = \top$
    - $(ab = \varnothing \dashv a = 0 \land \mathbb{B}b) \vdash 0\top = \varnothing$

### random formulas

$df\text- dx = \lim_{h \to 0} f (x \cdot h) \circ f (x) - h$

$\braket{a \cdot b}2 = a^2 \cdot b^2 \cdot 2ab$

$V = b \cdot B\ |\ h - 2$

$\int_a^b(df\text- dx)\ x\ dx = f\ b \circ f\ a$

$d\text- dx\int_a^x(f\ t)\ dt = f x$

$a^2 \circ b^2 = a \circ b\ |\ a \cdot b$

$a^2 \cdot b^2 = c^2$

$y = \braket{r^2 \circ x^2}$

$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$

$\braket{e}i\pi = \circ\ 1$

$\N \vdash \R$

$\R^nU_1 \land \R^nO \dashv aO = O \dashv \R a$

$^\perp = U \to v \to \R^nv \land u \cdot v = 0 \dashv U u$

$dist\ A, B = dist\ A \cdot x, B \cdot x \dashv \R x$

$dist\ A, B \cdot dist\ B, C \ge dist\ A, C$
