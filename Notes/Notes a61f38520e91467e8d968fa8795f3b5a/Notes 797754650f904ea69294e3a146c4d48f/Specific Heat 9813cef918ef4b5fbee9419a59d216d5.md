# Specific Heat

## Formula

$Q = mc\Delta T$, where

$Q$ is the potential [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) stored in the form of heat, see [Electromagnetic Wave](Electromagnetic%20Wave%209c989526af244e4f8d22ec72c535a026.md)

$m$ is the mass of the body

$c$ is the specific heat of the body

$\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the body
