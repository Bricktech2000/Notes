## finding the [Molecular Geometry](Molecular%20Geometry%20c2905128c21b42708ef68d6c619e9fc3.md)

use the right [Molecular Geometry](Molecular%20Geometry%20c2905128c21b42708ef68d6c619e9fc3.md) based on the number of atoms in the molecule

## choosing the right [Resonance Structure](Resonance%20Structure%2035ad97eb739d455e863b8d4b8c70613d.md)

each molecule could take the form of multiple [Resonance Structure](Resonance%20Structure%2035ad97eb739d455e863b8d4b8c70613d.md)s when double [Bond](Bond%203e540ea0ab234eca9486d144a72f898e.md)s are present. the preferred molecule is the one with preferred [Formal Charge](Formal%20Charge%200c878bc6e5bc4616846b4bc44238b3f0.md)s. if multiple [Resonance Structure](Resonance%20Structure%2035ad97eb739d455e863b8d4b8c70613d.md)s have the same lowest [Formal Charge](Formal%20Charge%200c878bc6e5bc4616846b4bc44238b3f0.md), then the actual molecule is the average of all those [Resonance Structure](Resonance%20Structure%2035ad97eb739d455e863b8d4b8c70613d.md)s.

### example

$SO_3$ could have one double bond, two double bonds or three double bonds. however, when using three double bonds, the formal charges of all $O$ atoms and of the $S$ atom are all $0$, which is preferred. for this reason, $SO_3$ has three double bonds.

## drawing using [Lewis Structure](Lewis%20Structure%202fec962a74f54c94a1ed518bf85b08ce.md)

*each bond is two electrons*

follow [Lewis Structure](Lewis%20Structure%202fec962a74f54c94a1ed518bf85b08ce.md): draw bonds as lines and lone electrons as dots. respect molecular geometries.
