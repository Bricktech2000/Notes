# Drawing a Molecule

see [Bond](Bond%203e540ea0ab234eca9486d144a72f898e.md)

based on the *Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory* (VSEPR), our guiding principle is to keep electron groups as far away from one another as possible.

## types of molecular geometries

### Linear

*line*

$180\degree$ between each atom

### Trigonal Planar

*triangle*

$120\degree$ between each atom

### Tetrahedral

*tetrahedron*

$\sim 109.5\degree$ between each atom

### Trigonal Bipyramidal

*triangular bipyramid, or octahedron with one vertex missing*

$180\degree$ between the two atoms on top of each pyramid

$120\degree$ between atoms in the base of the pyramid

$90\degree$ between atoms in the base and on top of the pyramid

### Octahedral

*octahedron*

$90\degree$ between each atom
