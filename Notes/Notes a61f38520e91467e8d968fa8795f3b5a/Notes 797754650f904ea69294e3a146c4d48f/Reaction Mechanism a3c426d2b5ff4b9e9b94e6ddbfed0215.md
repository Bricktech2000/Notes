# Reaction Mechanism

see [Reaction Rate](Reaction%20Rate%2015b549be89df4681b668a5c52d129a36.md), [Equilibrium](Equilibrium%20a8f9599f4a064c8b9f37ae20f90835c3.md)

## Elementary Steps

they are the reactions that make up a mechanism

in an elementary step, partial orders (reaction orders) are equal to the [Stoichiometry](Stoichiometry%20a398038171b54bd2ab9fe08da84b4c32.md)c coefficients (see [Reaction Rate](Reaction%20Rate%2015b549be89df4681b668a5c52d129a36.md))

### Molecularity

*the number of reactants present in the elementary step*

- unimolecular
- bimolecular
- termolecular

### Rate-Determining Step

the slowest elementary step in a mechanism determines its [Reaction Rate](Reaction%20Rate%2015b549be89df4681b668a5c52d129a36.md)

- if the fist step is a fast [Equilibrium](Equilibrium%20a8f9599f4a064c8b9f37ae20f90835c3.md), then the rate-determining step is the second step
- otherwise, the first step is the rate-determining step
