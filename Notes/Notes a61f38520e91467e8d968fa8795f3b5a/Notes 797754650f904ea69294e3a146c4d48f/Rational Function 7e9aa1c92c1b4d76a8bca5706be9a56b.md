# Rational Function

> basically, a polynomial divided by a different polynomial

$f(x) = \frac{numerator}{denominator}$

## vertical asymptotes

- when $denominator = 0$
- calculate using $\lim_{denominator \to 0} f(x)$

## horizontal asymptotes

- when $x$ approaches infinity
- calculate using $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$ (by considering the highest powers of x in the numerator and in the denominator)

## holes

- when $numerator = 0$ and $denominator = 0$
- simplify the function to calculate
