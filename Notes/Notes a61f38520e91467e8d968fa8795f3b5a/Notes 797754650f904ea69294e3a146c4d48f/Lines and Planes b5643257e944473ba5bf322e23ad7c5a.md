# Lines and Planes

see [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md), [Classical Math Notation](../Tags%20b793d46ea133446daa88889450d15033/Classical%20Math%20Notation%20eb53679093ce497baa118d7bfde14d6c.md)

## Equation of a line through two points

let $a$ and $b$ be [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md)s in $\R^n$

the parametric equation of the line is as follows (with [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md)s in $\R^3$ as an example):

$(x, y, z) = a + t(b - a)$

the canonical equation of the line is as follows (with [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md)3 as an example):

$\frac{x - a_x}{b_x - a_x} = \frac{y - a_y}{b_y - a_y} = \frac{z - a_z}{b_z - a_z}$

## Point of intersection of two lines or of two planes

the point of intersection of two lines can be calculated by setting both slope-intercept equations $x$, $y$, $z$... equal to each other, and plugging into one of the original equations. with parametric equations, convert to slope-intercept equations first or just interpret both equations as a system, solving for $x$, $y$, $z$...

let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be lines in $\R^n$

$L_1 = m_1a_1 + b_1$

$L_2 = m_2a_2 + b_2$

$(m_1a_1 + b_1) = (m_2a_2 + b_2)$

solve for $m_1$ and $m_2$, and plug into original equations

## Slope-intercept form

$y = mx + b$, where

$m$ is the slope of the line, $m_{1x} / m_{1y}$

$b$ is the y-intercept of the line, when $x = 0$, then solve for $y$
