## Principles

*How People Make Decisions*

### People Face Tradeoffs

> **Efficiency**: the property of society getting the most it can from its [Scarce Resource](Scarce%20Resource%205a16a077d8d84f198a0715ebf3b062ae.md)s
> 

> **Equity**: the property of distributing economic prosperity fairly among the members of society
> 

### The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get it

> **Opportunity Cost**: whatever must be given up to obtain some item
> 

### Rational People Think at the Margin

> **Rational people**: those who systematically and purposefully do the best they can do to achieve their objectives
> 

> **Marginal changes**: small incremental adjustments to a plan of action
> 

### People Respond to Incentives

> **Incentive**: something that induces a person to act
> 

*How People Interact*

### Trade *Can* Make Everyone Better Off

trades allows a group of people to specialize in what they do best

### Markets are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity

> **Market Economy**: an economy that allocats resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services
> 

### Governments can *Sometimes* Improve Market Outcomes

governments are necessary

- to inforce property rights

> **Property Rights**: the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over [Scarce Resource](Scarce%20Resource%205a16a077d8d84f198a0715ebf3b062ae.md)s
> 
- to intervene in the economy by promoting **Efficiency** and **Equity**

> **Market Failure**: a situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate ressources efficiently
> 

> **Externality**: the impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander
> 

> **Market Power**: the ability pf a single economic actor (or a small group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices
> 

*How the Economy Works as a Whole*

### A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to
Produce [Goods and Services](Goods%20and%20Services%201b1330b51e904b2d9ca4da265ebb7d86.md)

> **Productivity**: the quantity of [Goods and Services](Goods%20and%20Services%201b1330b51e904b2d9ca4da265ebb7d86.md) produced from each hour of a worker’s time
> 

### Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money

[Inflation](Inflation%20dade0600a7354cc59533efb2aca44b58.md)

### Society Faces a Short-Run Tradeoff between Inflation and Unemployment

this short-run tradeoff plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle

> **Business Cycle**:  the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured by the production of [Goods and Services](Goods%20and%20Services%201b1330b51e904b2d9ca4da265ebb7d86.md) or the number of people employed

## Macro VS Micro
