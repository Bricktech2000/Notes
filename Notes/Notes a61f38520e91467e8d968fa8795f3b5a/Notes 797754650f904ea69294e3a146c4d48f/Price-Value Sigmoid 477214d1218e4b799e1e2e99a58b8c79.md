### horizontal axis

price using a logarithmic scale

### vertical axis

value using a linear scale

### examples

below are the position of some items I own on the curve (note that the value stated is on the horizontal axis above)

- Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G at $2$ — paying twice the money impacts the value less than paying half the money
- Creality Ender 3 at $0$ — paying twice the money impacts the value the same as paying half the money
- Lenovo Flex 5 2-in-1 at $\circ 1$ — paying twice the money impacts the value more than paying half the money
