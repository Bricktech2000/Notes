# OOP

*Object-Oriented Programming*

the goal of OOP is to build objects based on their real-world properties, in contrast to functional programming or to procedural programming

## Pillars of OOP

— Google and Grepper

### Abstraction

Partial Abstraction & Interfaces

### Encapsulation

Private Field & Getter & Setter

### Inheritance

Super and Sub Class

### Polymorphism

Static - Overloading & Dynamic - Overriding

## Principles of OOP

— Google and Grepper

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility for a single part of that program's functionality*

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

*software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification*

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

*objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application*

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

*Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use*

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

*high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions*
