### example

if you tell a 5-year-old to clean their room, they will be able to do it. however, if you do the same with a 3-year-old, they will not be able to “focus” for long enough. in this case, however, not being able to “focus” is caused by the fact that the 3-year-old is overwhelmed by the task. they cannot separate “clean your room” into its component parts: “put your books in the shelve”, “move your stuffed animals on your bed”, and so on. “Cleaning a room” is too abstract of an idea for them.
