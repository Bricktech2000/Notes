## sizes of bonds

a triple bond is strong than a double bond, which is stronger than a single bond. similarly, a triple bond is shorter than a double bond, which is shorter than a single bond.

### notation

bonds between atoms $A$ and $B$ are represented as follows

1. $A - B$ ($A : B$) — Single Bond
2. $A = B$ — Double Bond
3. $A \equiv B$ — Triple Bond

## types of bonds

*there are three different main kinds of bonds*

### Ionic Bond

### properties

- between two atoms, one metal and one non-metal
- involves the transfer of electrons: one has gained electrons, one has lost electrons
- 2 opposite charges attract, forming a bond

### substance properties

- results in the formation of ionic solids such as crystals
- very stable, high melting points, boiling points, rigid
- they cleave along a line
- often very soluble in polar solvents such as water

### Metallic Bond

### properties

- between metals
- a surface (sea) of electrons allows for great conductivity
- bonds are very strong

### substance properties

- they tend to deform, very malleable and ductile
- very high melting and boiling points

### Covalent Bond

### properties

- between non-metals
- involves sharing of electrons
- one bond consists of 2 electrons shared between two atoms, not necessarily equally, see [Electronegativity](Electronegativity%20153347b799c64c06a1f86bb22efbe236.md)

### substance properties

- a lot more colour
- tend to be brittle
- molecular substances, we could theoretically isolate a single molecule
- generally have reasonably strong intermolecular bonds, but weak intramolecular bonds
- low melting points, low density, low boiling points
