## Midpoint of a Titration

*enough titrant has been released to allow half the analyte to be neutralized*

$[A-] = [HA] \therefore pH = pK_a \therefore [H^+] = K_a$ (see [Buffer](Buffer%202b4195d93d3f49e9a749dfc58749802e.md))

$V_{b\ at\ midpoint} = \frac{1}{2}V_{b\ at\ equivalence}$

## Equivalence Point of a Titration

*the amount of titrant added is just enough to completely neutralize the analyte solution*

$n_a = n_b \therefore C_aV_a = C_bV_b$ where $C$ and $V$ are concentrations and volumes respectively

$pH_\text{strong acid - strong base} = 7$

$pH_\text{strong acid - weak base} < 7$

$pH_\text{weak acid - strong base} > 7$

$pH_\text{weak acid - weak base}$ depends on whether the acid or the base is stronger (won't be asked in [CHM1301 Principles of Chemistry](../CHM1301%20Principles%20of%20Chemistry%20fbd6212a61d0406ca50755b78e533e89.md))
