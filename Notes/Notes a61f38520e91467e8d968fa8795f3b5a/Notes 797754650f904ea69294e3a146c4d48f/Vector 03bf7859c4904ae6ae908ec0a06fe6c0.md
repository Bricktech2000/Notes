# Vector

## Vectors in $\R^n$

### Magnitude

$|V|$, where

$V$ is the vector to find the magnitude of

### Orientation

$\frac{V}{|V|} = (cos(\theta), sin(\theta))$, where

$V$ is the vector to find the direction of

$\theta$ is the angle of the vector

note that $\frac{\vec V}{|\vec V|}$ is just notation for the direction of the vector $V$

### Dot Product

$a \cdot b = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}a_ib_i$

$a \cdot b = |a||b|\cos \theta$, where

$\theta$ is the angle between $a$ and $b$

*If vectors are identified with row matrices, the dot product can also be written as a matrix product* — Wikipedia

$a \cdot b = ab^\intercal$

**examples**

$[3, 2, -1] \cdot [4, -6, 3] = 3 \times 4 + 2 \times -6 + -1 \times 3 = -3$

$\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 & -1\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -6 & 3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 & -1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -6 \\ 3\end{bmatrix} = -3$

### Cross Product

*the cross product is only defined with vectors in $\R^3$*

*results in a vector of length (area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors) and of orientation (perpendicular to the plane formed by the two vectors)* — 3B1B

> the determinant is all about measuring how areas change during a transformation. after the transformation, the $1 \times 1$ unit square formed by $\vec i$ and $\vec j$ gets turned into the parallelogram formed by the two vectors— 3B1B

$|a \times b| = \det(\begin{bmatrix} a\ |\ b\end{bmatrix})$

$a \times b = \det(\begin{bmatrix}B\ |\  a\ |\ b\end{bmatrix})$, where

$B$ is the basis vector, i.e. $\begin{bmatrix}\hat i \\ \hat j  \\ \dots\end{bmatrix}$

**shortcut for calculating the cross product of vectors in $\R^3$**

$\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_2b_3 - b_2a_3 \\ a_3b_1 - b_3a_1 \\ a_1b_2 - b_1a_2\end{bmatrix}$

**properties**

$a \times b = -b \times a$

$a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$, and

$(b + c) \times a = b \times a + c \times a$

$k(a \times b) = (ka) \times b = a \times (kb)$, think of this intuitively

### Angles Between two Vectors

*no idea why this actually works*

$\cos \theta = \frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|}$

$\sin \theta = \frac{a \times b}{|a||b|}$

**Orthogonal Vectors**

*a pair of vectors offset by $90\degree$*

$u$ and $v$ are orthogonal if $u \cdot v = 0$

**Collinear Vectors**

*a pair of parallel vectors*

$u$ and $v$ are colinear if $u = kv$

### Projections

*The scalar projection is equal to the length of the vector projection* — Wikipedia

$|proj_ba| = |a|\cos\theta$, and

$proj_ba = (|a|\cos\theta) \hat b = (a \cdot \hat b) \hat b =   \frac{a \cdot b}{b \cdot b}b$, where

$proj_ba$ is the *vector projection of $a$ on $b$*

$|proj_ba|$ is the *scalar projection of $a$ on $b$*

$\hat b$ is the unit vector in the direction of $b$, $\frac{b}{|b|}$

### Volume of the parallelepiped defined by 3 vectors in  $\R^3$

*does this seem random? well, it is.*

$V = |w \cdot (u \times v)|$, where

$V$ is the volume calculated

$u$, $v$ and $w$ are the three vectors in $\R^3$

### Equation of a line through two vectors

let $a$ and $b$ be vectors in $\R^n$

the equation of the line is as follows (with vectors in $\R^3$ as an example):

$(x, y, z) = a + t(b - a)$

### Point of intersection of two lines or of two planes

the point of intersection of two lines can be calculated by setting both slope-intercept equations $x$, $y$, $z$... equal to each other, and plugging into one of the original equations. with parametric equations, convert to slope-intercept equations first or just interpret both equations as a system, solving for $x$, $y$, $z$...

let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be lines in $\R^n$

$L_1 = m_1a_1 + b_1$

$L_2 = m_2a_2 + b_2$

$(m_1a_1 + b_1) = (m_2a_2 + b_2)$

solve for $m_1$ and $m_2$, and plug into original equations

### Slope-intercept form

$y = mx + b$, where

$m$ is the slope of the line, $m_{1x} / m_{1y}$

$b$ is the y-intercept of the line, when $x = 0$, then solve for $y$

$\det(\begin{bmatrix}k_{1,1} & k_{2,1} \\ k_{2, 1} & k_{2, 2}\end{bmatrix}) = k_{1,1}k_{2,2} - k_{1,2}k_{2,1}$
