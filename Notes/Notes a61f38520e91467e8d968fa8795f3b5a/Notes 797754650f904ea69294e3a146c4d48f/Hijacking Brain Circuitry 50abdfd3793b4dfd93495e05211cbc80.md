*unlocking rewards by unconsciously manipulating hard-wired brain circuitry*

the brain circuitry being hijacked is often related to our [Intent to Mastery](Intent%20to%20Mastery%20d190e02a20f241eab0dcafe7575a078f.md)

## examples

### Parasocial Relationships

example with Sasha Grey — [https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=7128](https://youtu.be/DMw8G3RPWrQ?t=7128)

example of items that should come at a certain “tier” of a relationship, but can also be experienced simply through watching a Twitch stream:

- seeing a vulnerable part of a popular streamer
- having frequent live 1-to-1 conversation with the streamer through the chat. *you can talk to the streamer and they will respond to you*
- inside jokes between the streamer and the audience
- laughing and having a good time with the streamer
- “remember when... ?”
- some streamers calling their viewers their “besties” and telling them they “love them”

> I think what social media platforms are discovering is that the stronger the parasocial relationship, probably the higher the user engagement — Dr K.

other examples of weaker parasocial relationships

- listening to music from an artist
- going to an artist’s concert
