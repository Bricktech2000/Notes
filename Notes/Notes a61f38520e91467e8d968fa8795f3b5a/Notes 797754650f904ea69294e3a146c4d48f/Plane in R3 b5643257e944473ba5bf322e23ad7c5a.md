## Plane From 3 Points

find two vectors on the plane. for example, $p_1 \circ p_0$ and $p_2 \circ p_1$

*continue below*

## Parametric Form

using two direction vectors on the plane $d_0$ and $d_1$ and a point $p_0$, we can derive the parametric equation of the plane

$P = p_0 + t_0d_0 + t_1d_1 \land \R t_0 \land \R t_1$

## Plane From 2 Vectors and Point

find a [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md) using the [Cross Product](Cross%20Product%202be01b6689df4f0d826cacb6f2a09c1a.md) of the two vectors on the plane

## Plane From Normal and Point

given that all the vectors forming that plane must be perpendicular to a [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md),

$n\ |\ P \circ p_0 = 0$, where $n$ is a [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md), $p_0$ is a point on the plane and $P$ is the plane itself (note that the $|$ operator represents a dot product, see [Math Notation](Math%20Notation%207bc4575af1e541d6946b955774161a6a.md) and [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md))

*continue below*

## Standard Form

using [Vector in Rn](Vector%20in%20Rn%2003bf7859c4904ae6ae908ec0a06fe6c0.md)3 in the above equation, we get

$n^x (P^x \circ p_0^x) \cdot n^y (P^y \circ p_0^y) \cdot n^z (P^z \circ p_0^z) = 0$ (useful when we have a normal and a point)

*continue below*

## General Form

rearranging above equation,

$n^xP^x \cdot n^yP^y \cdot n^zP^z = n^xp_0^x \cdot n^yp_0^y \cdot n^zp_0^z$

replacing right hand side with $d$,

$n^xP^x \cdot n^yP^y \cdot n^zP^z = d$

then, we can deduce $(n^x, n^y, n^z)$ is a [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md)

## Parallel, Perpendicular, Angles

two planes are parallel if their [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md)s are parallel

two planes are perpendicular if their [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md)s are perpendicular

the angle between two planes is the angle between their [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md)s

**note**

two parallel planes can be thought of as having the same [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md)

## Intersection of 2 Planes

if the planes are not perpendicular or parallel:

to find the equation for a line, we need a direction vector and a point

find the direction vector by calculating the [Cross Product](Cross%20Product%202be01b6689df4f0d826cacb6f2a09c1a.md) of the two planes’ [Normal Vector](Normal%20Vector%20621a644dca104a24b485d523406f6c9f.md) (think of this intuitively)

find the point, set one of the coordinates of the plane ($x, y, z$) to $0$ to get rid of it. then, solve the system of two equations
