# Electromagnetic Wave

see [Wavelength](Wavelength%2083dd192c85704a6c9e26815c77280c01.md), [Frequency](Frequency%200ed2a5a3456849569b593d7d6411b8b4.md), [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md)

$\nu\lambda = c$, where

$c$ is the speed of light

$\nu$ is the frequency of the wave

$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave

$E = h\mu$, where

$E$ is the energy carried by the wave

$h$ is Plank's constant

$\nu$ is the frequency of the wave

$KE = h\nu - \phi$, where

$KE$ is the energy of the ejected electron

$h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light

$\phi$ is the binding energy or work function (the energy holding the electron to the atom)

$1nm = 1 \times 10^{-9}m$
