see [Wavelength](Wavelength%2083dd192c85704a6c9e26815c77280c01.md), [Frequency](Frequency%200ed2a5a3456849569b593d7d6411b8b4.md), [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md)

a particle of light is called a *photon*

## Formulas

### Wave Equation

$\nu\lambda = c$, where

$c$ is the speed of light

$\nu$ is the [Frequency](Frequency%200ed2a5a3456849569b593d7d6411b8b4.md) of the wave

$\lambda$ is the [Wavelength](Wavelength%2083dd192c85704a6c9e26815c77280c01.md) of the wave

### Planckâ€“Einstein Relation

$E = h\nu$, where

$E$ is the [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) carried by one photon

$h$ is Plank's constant

$\nu$ is the [Frequency](Frequency%200ed2a5a3456849569b593d7d6411b8b4.md) of the wave

### Photoelectric Effect

$KE = h\nu - \phi$, where

$KE$ is the kinetic [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) of the ejected electron

$h\nu$ is the [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) of the incident light

$\phi$ is the binding energy or work function (the energy holding the electron to the atom)

### other equations

$E_T = E_{photon} \times \text{number of photons}$, where

$E_T$ is the total [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) in the wave, see [Specific Heat](Specific%20Heat%209813cef918ef4b5fbee9419a59d216d5.md)

$E_{photon}$ is the [Energy](Energy%2032255c9dff45446aa251c5a99e89be93.md) carried by one photon
