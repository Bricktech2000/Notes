# Calculating a Derivative

see [Derivative Rules](Derivative%20Rules%200d7442b53d47460f98161b1c7fc77f81.md), [Classical Math Notation](../Tags%20b793d46ea133446daa88889450d15033/Classical%20Math%20Notation%20eb53679093ce497baa118d7bfde14d6c.md)

## Differentiation

apply [Derivative Rules](Derivative%20Rules%200d7442b53d47460f98161b1c7fc77f81.md) recursively

## Implicit Differentiation

> Derivation of an implicit equation (where the dependent variable is not isolated). Works with both functions and relations that aren't functions.

### example

$x^2 + y^2 = 2$

$\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(2)$

$2x + 2y \times \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$

$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$
