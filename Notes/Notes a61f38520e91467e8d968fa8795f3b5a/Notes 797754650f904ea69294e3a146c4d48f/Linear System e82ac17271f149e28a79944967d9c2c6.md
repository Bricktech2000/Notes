### notation

the following linear system:

$x + y + 2z = 3$

$x - y + z = 2$

$y - z = 1$

can be represented by the following Augmented [Matrix](Matrix%206026e6fbedbc408786c22ac9d716a282.md):

$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & | & 3 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & | & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & -1  & | & 1\end{bmatrix}$

## Elementary Operations

*operations we’re allowed to do and that don’t change the general solution of the system*

- add a multiple of a row to another row
- swap the position of two rows
- multiply a row by a non-zero scalar

## Row Echelon Form

*REF*

a [Matrix](Matrix%206026e6fbedbc408786c22ac9d716a282.md) (augmented or not) is in REF if:

- all zero rows are at the bottom
- the first nonzero entry in each row is a $1$ (called the *pivot*) (this criterion seems to be wrong according to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination))
- each pivot is to the right of each pivot in all rows above

### putting a [Matrix](Matrix%206026e6fbedbc408786c22ac9d716a282.md) in REF

use [Gaussian Elimination](Gaussian%20Elimination%20df8352a2ce4e49d0b1bc4a89a245a9f4.md)

### determining the type of the general solution

- if the matrix contains a row in the form $\begin{bmatrix}0 & \dots & 0 & | & b\end{bmatrix} \land b \ne 0$, the system has no solutions
- else, if every column has a pivot, the system has one unique solution
- else, if there is a column with no pivot, the system has an infinite number of solutions

## Reduced Row Echelon Form

*RREF*

a matrix is in RREF if:

- the matrix is in REF
- each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column

### finding the general solution

- if there is a unique solution, then the solution is the vector in the augmented column (ignore the $\begin{bmatrix}0 & \dots & 0 & | & 0\end{bmatrix}$ rows, if any)
- else, each pivot corresponds to one row of the augmented matrix. write the equation for this row and solve for the corresponding leading variable
