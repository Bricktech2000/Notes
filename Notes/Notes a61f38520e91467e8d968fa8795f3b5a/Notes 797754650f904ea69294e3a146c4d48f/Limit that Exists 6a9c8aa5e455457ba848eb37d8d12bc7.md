# Limit that Exists

see [Classical Math Notation](Classical%20Math%20Notation%20eb53679093ce497baa118d7bfde14d6c.md)

$\lim_{x \to a}$ doesn't exist if

- $\lim_{x \to a+} \ne \lim_{x \to a-}$
- $x$ is on a vertical asymptote
- wild behavior (not a technical term), i. e. $\lim_{x \to 0} sin(\frac{\pi}{x})$

same can be said when

- the denominator is $0$
- an absolute value is present
