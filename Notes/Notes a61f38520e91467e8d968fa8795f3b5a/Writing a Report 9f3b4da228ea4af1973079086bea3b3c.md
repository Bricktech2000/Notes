# Writing a Report

## best practices

*for [ENG1112](ENG1112%202a1e789232354ebfa8015efb7ea6e2a1.md)*

- the goal of a report is to communicate our analysis of information, not to "dump" information
- make sure to find [Reliable Source](Reliable%20Source%20d684962a79654cc5992f95c108557659.md)s
- [Finding Sources](Finding%20Sources%208ecdd58f45424ecbbfb9c8d18147c5f4.md) and [Referencing Sources](Referencing%20Sources%209dbf35909a594ff1aa3f82c6505af71f.md)
- get familiar with the different [Types of Sources](Types%20of%20Sources%206d651b5a155a4fd6ae76ed810217a68c.md)
- sources **must be discussed and quoted/cited** in the body of reports, not just in the bibliography
- avoid cherry-picking sources to prove a point
- going into detail about both sides of a topic is *not* required, but it is important to acknowledge that there is another side to it
- no source is perfect, so mention limitations in reports

- it is valid to use the opinions of article authors in a report
- block quotations have a bad reputation when it comes to university reports because it can make it seem like the student wanted to make the report seem longer than it really is. the only way to really justify a block quotation is to analyze it thoroughly

- create an outline for the report
- collect evidence for each item in the outline
