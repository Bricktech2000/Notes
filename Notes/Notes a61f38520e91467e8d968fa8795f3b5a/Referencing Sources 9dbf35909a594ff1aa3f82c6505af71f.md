usually, if an article has 1, 2 or 3 authors, list them all. otherwise, list the first one and "et al.", which is Latin for "and others"

### referencing websites

the author is an abbreviation of the website name, but that still allows it to be identified in the bibliography. examples:

> (Addiction, 2012)
(Internet Addiction, 2012)
(New Treatments, 2012)
