- useful to find more detailed, reliable information
- uses very little AI and doesn't personalize results

### formulating a research string

- make it specific enough so that a manageable amount of results is returned
- use synonyms where applicable
- use operators such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `"`, `*`...
- avoid general terms such as:
    
    > cause, effect, determine, factors, role, research, trends, benefits, advantages, drawbacks, disadvantages, impacts...
    > 

**example**

sample search string using synonyms, operators, wildcard and quotes

```jsx
("sea level" AND (rise OR change))
AND (coast*)
AND (wetland OR marsh)
AND Florida
```

## Search Engines

*search engines are not a source on their own, they are a way to find sources.*

- Google Scholar is a branch of Google that specializes in finding academic sources ([Types of Sources](Types%20of%20Sources%206d651b5a155a4fd6ae76ed810217a68c.md)), but it might not be ideal for university reports
- before using them, ask yourself *Why?* **don't use search engines to save time**
- there is no easy way to determine whether the information is reliable or useful, [Reliable Source](Reliable%20Source%20d684962a79654cc5992f95c108557659.md)
- they are good for finding general information and getting an overview of a topic
