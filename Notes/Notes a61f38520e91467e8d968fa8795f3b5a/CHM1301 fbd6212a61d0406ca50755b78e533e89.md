# CHM1301

## general

- the teacher is there to fill in gaps and help clarify stuff, not to teach what we already know
- teacher there asynchronously (email is the best way to reach her, vrashmi@uottawa.ca)
- lab is asynchronous (reserve 3-5 hours in schedule recommended)
- homework deadlines are guidelines
- class is both online and in-person, *we can participate either way* (CRX C010 according to Brightspace)
