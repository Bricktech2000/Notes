# Punctuation

- *course's objective* is awkward to say (uses possessive grammar) whereas *course objective* is better (uses an adjective)
- serial comma (oxford comma) before an *and* at the end of a list is not wrong (but not required)
- use vivid, descriptive, subject-specific language (avoid *good, thing, etc.*)
- generally, a `;` is used instead of a period to indicate that two sentences are closely related
- a `-` is a [Hyphen](Hyphen%20dbf38a63abab407caaa60d092d7db4f4.md) (*well-written*) whereas a `--` is a [Dash](Dash%200c3252234ba64343995ca9e29f56e188.md) (*his report is excellent â€” clear, concise and informative*)
